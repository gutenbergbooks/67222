<p>On the 27th of December, 1905, Harvard University opened its
new house of philosophy, Emerson Hall. The presence of the American
Philosophical and Psychological Associations gave national significance
to the completion of this building.</p>

<p>The psychologist will find quarters in all parts of Emerson Hall.
The general courses in psychology will be held on the first floor in the
large lecture-room, which has nearly four hundred seats; and close
by are the psychological seminary-room and smaller lecture-rooms for
the advanced psychological courses. On the second floor the psychologist
finds his special library as a wing of the large library hall.
But the exclusive domain of the psychologist is the third floor,&mdash;a
psychological laboratory with twenty-five rooms. A large attic hall
for laboratory purposes on the fourth floor completes the psychologist's
allotment.</p>

<p>The work to be reported in future in the Harvard Psychological
Studies will be work done in this new building, and while the researches
reported in the following pages were completed in the smaller
quarters of the old laboratory, it seems natural that this volume, which
appears at this new epoch of our work, should give an account both
of our psychological past and of the development and purpose of
Emerson Hall.</p>

<p>The Harvard Psychological Laboratory was founded in 1891 by
Professor William James, who had introduced some experimental
features into his psychological lecture courses for some time before
the formal opening of a regular workshop. Professor James started
with two large rooms on the second floor of Dane Hall, and secured
an excellent equipment, especially for the study of the psychology of
the senses. He was assisted by Dr. Herbert Nichols, and at once
gathered a number of graduate students for research.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>In the following year Professor James withdrew from the experimental
work, and the conduct of the laboratory was given over to
me. In the years which followed, Dr. Arthur Pierce, Dr. J. E. Lough,
and Dr. Robert MacDougall were the assistants until three years ago,
when the development of the laboratory demanded a division of the
assistant functions; since that time Dr. E. B. Holt has been the assistant
for the work in human psychology, while Dr. R. M. Yerkes has
had charge of the work in comparative psychology. Since from the
first I laid special emphasis on research work, a greater number of
small rooms was soon needed. In the year 1893, we divided a part
of the adjacent lecture-room into four rooms for special investigations,
and two years later the larger of the two original rooms was divided
into five. As the lecture-room also was finally made part of the research
laboratory, we had at last eleven rooms in Dane Hall. The
activities of the laboratory, however, went far beyond the research
work. We had regular training-courses in experimental practice, and
the lecture courses in human and in comparative psychology drew
largely on the resources of our instrument cases. Yet the original
investigations absorbed the main energy of the laboratory, and demanded
a steady expansion of its apparatus. An illustrated catalogue
of the instruments has been published as part of the Harvard Exhibition
at the Chicago World's Fair.</p>

<p>The participation of the students has been controlled by a principle
which has characterized our Harvard work through all these
years, and distinguished it from the methods of most other institutions.
I insist that no student shall engage in one investigation only,
but that every one who has charge of a special problem shall give
to it only half of his working time, while in the other half he is to be
subject in four, five, or more investigations by other members of the
laboratory. In this way each research is provided with the desirable
number of subjects, and all one-sidedness is avoided. Every experimenter
thus comes in contact with a large range of problems and
gets a fair training in manifold observations, besides the opportunity
for concentration on a special research. It is true that this demands
a complicated schedule and careful consideration of the special needs
of every research, but it gives to the work a certain freshness and
vividness, and banishes entirely the depression which is unavoidable
whenever a student is for any length of time a passive subject in one
psychological enquiry only. In both capacities, as experimenter and
as observing subject, only graduate students have been acceptable.
In this way about <em>one hundred investigations</em> on human psychology<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
have been carried on, for most of which I have proposed the problems
and the special lines of work, taking care that the research of
succeeding years and of succeeding generations of graduate students
should show a certain internal continuity. Whenever the results
seemed fit for publication, the papers have been published under the
names of the students who had the responsibility for the conduct of
the experiments. Until three years ago the publication was scattered;
most of the papers, however, appeared in the Psychological Review.
The Harvard Psychological Studies, beginning in 1903, are to gather
the bulk of our material, although not a few of the researches of
recent years have been published in other places.</p>

<p>The laboratory has always sought to avoid one-sidedness, and this
the more as it was my special aim to adjust the selection of topics
to the personal equations of the students, many of whom came with
the special interests of the physician, the zoÃ¶logist, the artist, the
pedagogue, and so on. My own special interests may have emphasized
those problems which refer to the motor functions and their
relations to attention, apperception, space-sense, time-sense, feeling,
etc. At the same time I have tried to develop the psychological-Ã¦sthetic
work, which has become more and more a special branch
of our laboratory, and there has been no year in which I have not
insisted on some investigations in the fields of association, memory,
and educational psychology. On the other hand, in a happy supplementation
of interests, Dr. Holt has emphasized the physiological
psychology of the senses, and Dr. Yerkes has quickly developed
a most efficient experimental department of animal psychology.</p>

<p>As the work thus became more manifold, the old quarters in Dane
Hall appeared less and less sufficient. And yet this laboratory development
has been merely parallel to the growth of general philosophical
studies in the whole University. The demand for a new hall,
exclusively devoted to philosophy, was thus suggested from many
sides. The idea of linking it with the name of Ralph Waldo Emerson
has been for years a cherished plan of Professor Palmer.</p>

<p>An especially appropriate time for the realization of such a plan
came in the approach of the hundredth anniversary of Emerson's
birthday. Almost two years before this date the Department took
the first steps in seeking to interest the members of the Visiting Committee
for the collection of the necessary funds. This Committee,
consisting of Mr. G. B. Dorr, chairman, Mr. R. H. Dana, Dr. R.
Cabot, Mr. J. Lee, Mr. D. Ward, and Mr. R. C. Robbins, showed
not only warm interest, but lent itself to the furtherance of the plans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
with such an energy and devotion that the Philosophical Department
owes to these friends of philosophy in Harvard the most lasting gratitude.
Various means were taken by the Committee and by the Department
to stir the interest of the public, and soon the gifts began to
come in, gifts of which some were clearly given from sympathy with
the work of the Philosophical Department, some evidently in memory
of Emerson. The original plans of the architect called for $150,000
for the building. When, on the 25th of May, 1903, the hundredth
anniversary of Emerson's birthday was celebrated, the University
had contributions amounting to more than this sum, and given by
one hundred and seventy persons.</p>

<p>It was soon found, however, that this sum was inadequate; yet
we never asked in vain. Additional gifts came in for the building
fund, just as later the generosity of several friends furnished the
building with a handsome equipment and the laboratory with new
instruments. Mr. R. C. Robbins gave the books for a philosophical
library to be placed in the new Hall.</p>

<p>The architect chosen was Mr. Guy Lowell, who has had to labor
under the difficulties involved in the fact that the best and quietest
available place was on Quincy Street opposite Robinson Hall. This
spot demanded that the new building be harmonized with Robinson
and Sever Halls, two structures most unlike in their architectural
style. There was not even the possibility of making it a companion
to Robinson Hall, since the latter has but two stories, while it was
evident that Emerson Hall needed three stories. The plan finally
accepted, a Greek, brick building with brick columns and rich limestone
trimmings, provided for the work of the whole Philosophical
Division with the exception of education. The Education Department,
with its large library, will soon need a whole building of its
own, and has thus had no interest in being housed under the roof of
Emerson Hall. On the other hand, the building was to give full space
to that part of our Philosophical Division which now forms, like education,
an administrative unity,&mdash;the Department of Social Ethics.
A special library, museum rooms, etc., for social ethics were planned
for the second floor by the munificence of an anonymous benefactor.
Altogether we have six large lecture-rooms, two library halls, two
collection-rooms, a department-room, a seminary-room, two studies
and conference-rooms, twenty-five laboratory-rooms, all connected
by very spacious, well-lighted halls and broad, imposing stairways.
Surely never before in the history of scholarship has such a stately
house been built for philosophy. And while the nature of the work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
is certainly not determined by the luxury of stone and carved wood,
teachers and students alike must feel these superb surroundings as
a daily stimulus to their best efforts.</p>

<p>At Christmas, 1905, the building stood ready for use, and Duveneck's
bronze statue of Emerson was unveiled in the entrance hall. At the
opening meeting, after short dedicatory orations by President Eliot
and Dr. Edward Emerson, a real exchange of ideas in a joint debate
of the Philosophical and Psychological Associations was substituted
for the usual formal exercises. The question debated was suggested
by the fact that Emerson Hall was to house the psychological laboratory.
Does psychology really belong to philosophy or rather to the
natural sciences? As the representative of Harvard, it was my part
to open the debate and to characterize the attitude of the Harvard
laboratory.</p>

<p>My remarks on that occasion may thus serve as the most direct introduction
to our work. They are printed here, together with a short
sketch of the equipment of the laboratory. I venture to add also two
other papers, one of which points to the administrative, the other
and longer one to the philosophical background of Emerson Hall.
Inasmuch as I was Chairman of the Philosophical Department
throughout the five years in which the plan for Emerson Hall was
growing and became finally realized, it has been my official duty
repeatedly to express our hopes and ideals. Thus I had to formulate
the wishes of the Department at the outset in a letter to the Visiting
Committee, a letter which was used as a circular in asking the public
for funds. Two years later when Harvard celebrated the Emerson
anniversary, I delivered an address on Emerson as philosopher. This
epistemological paper may seem far removed from the interests of
the Harvard Psychological Studies, and yet I am glad to print it in
this laboratory volume, and thus emphatically to indicate that I for
one consider philosophy the true basis for the psychologist.</p>

<p>There follow thus, first, the letter to the Visiting Committee, with
which the Emerson Hall movement took its official inception in
1901; secondly, the address delivered at Harvard on the celebration
of the Emerson anniversary in May, 1903; thirdly, the paper contributed
to the debate of the philosophers at the opening meeting
in December, 1905; and, finally, a description of the present status
of the laboratory in January, 1906.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[The letter addressed to the Visiting Committee of the Overseers of Harvard
University, in 1901, reads as follows:]</p></blockquote>

<p>Gentlemen,&mdash;The philosophical work in Harvard has in the last
twenty years gone through an inner development which has met
with a hearty response alike on the part of the University and of the
students. The students have attended the courses in constantly growing
numbers, the Governing Boards have provided the Division
amply with new teachers, steadily increasing the number of professors,
instructors, and assistants. The outer growth of the Division
has thus corresponded most fortunately to the internal development,
by an harmonious coÃ¶peration of the administration, the teachers,
and the students of the University. And yet there remains one other
factor as an essential condition for the healthy life of the Department,
a factor which cannot be provided by the University itself and for
which the help must come from without. Our work needs a dignified
home where under one roof all the varied philosophical work now
carried on at Harvard may be united. The need has been urgently
felt for many years, but only with the recent growth has the situation
become intolerable. It is therefore the unanimous opinion of the
Department that we must ask the public for the funds to build at
Harvard a "School of Philosophy," in the interest of the students
and of the teachers, in the interest of the Department and of the
University, in the interest of culture and of scholarship.</p>

<p>The present work of the Division of Philosophy can be indicated
by a few figures. We entered the current year with a teaching-staff
of six full professors, two assistant professors, four instructors, two
teaching-fellows, and six assistants. The instruction of these twenty
men covers the ground of history of philosophy, metaphysics, theory
of knowledge, psychology, logic, ethics, Ã¦sthetics, philosophy of
religion, philosophy of science and sociology. Thirty-two courses
have been offered. These courses are grouped in three classes: the
introductory courses, intended primarily for Sophomores and Juniors;
the systematic and historic courses, planned for Juniors, Seniors, and
Graduates; and the research courses for Graduates only. But the
students whom we try to reach differ not only with regard to their
classes, their corresponding maturity, and their degree of philosophical
preparation, but also with regard to the aims and interests
for which they elect philosophical studies in the University. The
one group seeks in our field liberal education. The fundamental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
problems of life and reality, and the historic solutions of them which
the great thinkers developed, the values of truth and beauty and
morality, the laws of the mental mechanism and of the social consciousness,
all these promise and prove to be incomparable agencies
for widening the soul and giving to our young men depth, strength,
and ideals. Not a few of the students who belong to this group
remain loyal to philosophy through three or four years. A second
group of students need our courses as preparation for divers
scholarly or practical aims. The future lawyer, teacher, physician,
minister, scientist, or philanthropist knows that certain courses in
ethics or psychology, in education or logic afford the most solid foundations
for his later work; there is hardly a course in our Division
which is not adjusted to some kind of professional study. The third
group finally, naturally the smallest, but to the teachers the most
important, consists of those to whom philosophy itself becomes a
life's work. The Harvard Department believes that there is nowhere
else in this country or abroad such an opportunity for systematic
and all-round training for an advanced student of philosophy as is
offered here, covering easily a man's full work for six years, advancing
from the introductory courses of the Sophomore year to the six
seminaries of the graduate years and finally reaching the doctor's
thesis in the third year after graduation.</p>

<p>The extent to which the Harvard students make use of these
opportunities is to be inferred from the figures which the last Annual
Report of the President offers. These refer to the year 1899-1900;
the current year will show somewhat the same proportions, perhaps
even an increase of graduate work. The figures are necessarily too
low, inasmuch as they refer merely to those students who take examinations
in the courses and omit those who merely attend the lectures.
The attendance in the philosophical courses was last year over one
thousand students. They belonged to all parts of the University,
188 Graduates, 210 Seniors, 218 Juniors, 175 Sophomores, 59 Specials,
57 Scientifics, 55 Divinity students, and the rest from the Freshman
class, the Law School, and the Medical School. The introductory
courses were attended by almost four hundred students, that is, by
a number corresponding to the size of the Junior class. As, in spite
of natural fluctuations, this figure is pretty constant,&mdash;in 1897 reaching
its maximum with 427,&mdash;it can be said that in Harvard under
the system of absolutely free election practically every student who
passes through Harvard required of himself at least a year of solid
philosophical study.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>An even higher interest, however, belongs to the figures which refer
to the most advanced courses offered, especially to the courses of
research. It has always been the most characteristic feature of the
Harvard Philosophical Department to consider the advancement of
knowledge as its noblest function. The productive scholarship of the
Department is shown by the fact that the last two years alone brought
before the public eight compendious scholarly works from members
of our Department, besides a large number of smaller contributions
to science. To train also in the students this highest scholarly attitude,
that of the critical investigator as contrasted with that of the
merely receptive hearer of lectures, is thus the natural aim of our
most advanced work; it is this spirit which has given to the Department
its position in the University and in the whole country.
This prevalence of the spirit of research is the reason why, as the
Report of the Dean of the Graduate School points out, the Philosophical
Department has a larger number of graduate students who
have carried on graduate studies elsewhere than any other Department
of the University. The table of the Dean which records these
migrating graduate students who come to us for advanced work after
graduate studies at other universities, is as follows: Mathematics 6,
Natural History 7, Political Science 7, Modern Languages 11, Classics 14,
History 15, English Literature 16, Philosophy 20. If we consider
the whole advanced work of the University, that is the totality of
those courses which are announced as "primarily for Graduates,"
we find that the following number of graduate students, including
the graduate members of the professional schools, have taken part:
Classics 103, Philosophy 96, English 75, German 61, History and
Government 52, Romance Languages 45, Mathematics 39, Economics 23,
Chemistry 21, in the other departments less than twenty. But this
situation turns still more strongly in favor of philosophy as soon as
we consider the technical research courses, those which in the language
of the catalogue are known as the 20-courses, and omit those
graduate courses which are essentially lecture courses. In these
research courses the number of Graduate Students is: Philosophy 71,
History and Government 34, Chemistry 13, ZoÃ¶logy 12, Geology 10,
and in the other departments less than ten.</p>

<p>These few figures may be sufficient to indicate not only the extent
of the Department and its influence, but above all the harmonious
character of this development. The most elementary courses, the
solid routine courses, and the most advanced courses, show equal
signs of growth and progress, and the whole work with its many side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
branches remains a well-connected unity with a clear systematic plan.
All this must be understood before one can appreciate the striking
contrast between the work and the workshop. It is of course easy
to say at once that the truth of a metaphysical thought does not
depend upon the room in which it is taught, and that the philosopher
is not, like a physicist or chemist, dependent upon outer equipments.
Yet, this is but half true, and the half of the statement which is false
is of great importance.</p>

<p>The dependence upon outer conditions is perhaps clearest in the
case of psychology, which has been for the last twenty-five years
an objective science with all the paraphernalia of an experimental
study: the psychologist of to-day needs a well-equipped laboratory no
less than the physicist. Harvard has given the fullest acknowledgment
to this modern demand and has spent large sums to provide
the University with the instruments of an excellent psychological
laboratory; the one thing which we miss is room, simply elbow-room.
Our apparatus is crowded in the upper story of Dane Hall, and even
that small story must give its largest room for the lectures of other
departments and another room to a philosophical reading-room.
The space which remains for the psychological work is so absolutely
out of proportion to the amount of work going on that the problem
how to bring all the men into those few rooms has become the most
difficult of all our laboratory problems. During the current year,
besides the training-courses, twenty-three men are engaged there in
original research, each one with a special investigation and each
one anxious to devote as much time as possible to his research; only
the most complicated adjustment makes it possible at all, and yet the
mutual disturbance, the necessity of passing through rooms in which
other men are working, and of stopping the work when other men
need the place interfere every day with the success of the instruction.
A mechanical workshop is an urgent need of our laboratory, and yet
we cannot afford the room; and while the only desirable arrangement
would be to have the psychological lectures in the same building
where the apparatus is stored,&mdash;as the instruments are necessary
for the experimental demonstrations,&mdash;there is no room for the
lectures under the roof of Dane Hall, which houses the Bursar's Office
and CoÃ¶perative Stores. The result is that the instruments must be
carried through the yard in rain or shine, an effective way to damage
our valuable equipment. But the evils connected with the present
locality of the psychological laboratory are not only such as result
from its narrowness. Its position on Harvard Square, with the con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>tinuous
noise and the vibration of the ground, is perfectly prohibitory
for large groups of psychological studies and disturbing for every
kind of work for which concentration of attention is a fundamental
condition. Finally a psychological laboratory, perhaps still more
than a physical one, needs in its whole construction a perfect adaptation
to its special purpose; the walls, the shape, and the connection
of the rooms, everything must be built, as has been done in other
universities, for the special end. We have merely the rooms of the
old Law School with thin partitions dividing them. In short everything
is in a state which was tolerable during the last few years only
because it was felt as provisional, but the time when the psychological
laboratory must have really adequate quarters cannot be postponed
much longer.</p>

<p>The needs of the psychological work can thus be easily demonstrated
to every beholder; but while perhaps less offensive on the
surface, the outer conditions of the other branches of the Philosophical
Department are not therefore less unsatisfactory. The advanced student
of logic or ethics does not need a laboratory, but he needs seminary-rooms
with a working library where his work may have a local
centre, where he can meet his instructors and his fellow students
engaged in related researches, where he may leave his books and
papers. To-day all this theoretical work has no home at all; the
seminaries seek refuge in an empty room of the laboratory at a late
evening hour, in a chance lecture-room, or in private homes; there
is nowhere continuity, no place to collect or to deposit, no opportunity
to meet beyond official hours, no feeling of coherence suggested by
surroundings. The most advanced research work of the country is
thus done under external conditions which suggest the spirit of a
schoolroom, conditions which deprive students and instructors equally
of the chance to make our seminaries the fitting forms for their rich
content. But if all this is most deeply felt by the advanced students,
it is not less true and not less deplorable for the undergraduate
courses. There is nowhere fixity of association between the work and
the room. The philosophy courses are scattered over the whole yard,
wandering each year from one quarter to the other, creeping in
wherever a vacant room can be found, not even the instructors
knowing where their nearest colleagues are meeting students. The
dignity and the unity of the work are equally threatened by such a
state of affairs. There remains not even a possibility for the instructor
to meet his students before or after the lecture; his room is filled
up to the time when he begins and a new class rushes in before he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
answered questions. A business-like restlessness intrudes into the
instruction, and yet philosophy above all needs a certain repose and
dignity.</p>

<p>Thus what we need is clear. We need a worthy monumental building
at a quiet central spot of the Harvard yard, a building which
shall contain large and small lecture-rooms, seminary-rooms, a reading-room,
and one whose upper story shall be built for a psychological
laboratory, so that under one roof all the philosophical work, metaphysical
and ethical, psychological and logical, may be combined.
Here the elementary and the advanced work, the lecture courses
and the researches, the seminaries and the experiments, the private
studies in the reading-room and the conferences and meetings of the
assistants would go on side by side. Here would be a real school of
philosophy where all Harvard men interested in philosophy might find
each other and where the students might meet the instructors.</p>

<p>Such a home would give us first, of course, the room and the
external opportunities for work on every plane; it would give us
also the dignity and the repose, the unity and the comradeship of
a philosophical academy. It would give us the inspiration resulting
from the mutual assistance of the different parts of philosophy,
which in spite of their apparent separation are still to-day parts of one
philosophy only. All this would benefit the students of philosophy
themselves, but not less good would come to the University as a
whole. The specialization of our age has brought it about that in the
organization of a university, even philosophy, or rather each of the
philosophical branches, has become an isolated study coÃ¶rdinated
with others. The average student looks to psychology as to physics
or botany; he thinks of ethics as he thinks of economics or history;
he hears about logic as coÃ¶rdinated with mathematics, and so on.
The University has somewhat lost sight of the unity of all philosophical
subjects and has above all forgotten that this united philosophy is
more than one science among other sciences, that it is indeed the
central science which alone has the power to give inner unity to the
whole university work. Every year our universities reward our most
advanced young scholars of philology and history, of literature and
economics, of physics and chemistry, of mathematics and biology
with the degree of Ph.D., that is of Doctor Philosophiae, thus symbolically
expressing that all the special sciences are ultimately only
branches of philosophy; but the truth of this symbol has faded
away from the consciousness of the academic community. All knowledge
appears there as a multitude of scattered sciences and the fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
that they all have once been parts of philosophy, till one after the other
has been dismissed from the mother arms, has been forgotten. A
school of philosophy as a visible unity in the midst of the yard will
renew this truth and thus give once more to the overwhelming manifoldness
of intellectual efforts of our University a real unity and interconnection;
the external connection of administration will be reÃ«nforced
by the inner unity of logical interdependence.</p>

<p>The time is ripe for a school of philosophy to play this rÃ´le and
to fulfil again its old historical mission, to be the unifying principle of
human knowledge and life. The second half of the nineteenth century
was essentially controlled by realistic energies, by the spirit of
analysis, by the triumph of natural science and technique. But a long
time before the century came to an end a reaction started throughout
the whole intellectual globe; the synthetic energies again came
to the foreground, the idealistic interests were emphasized in the
most different quarters; the historical and social sciences make
to-day the same rapid progress which fifty years ago characterized the
natural sciences, and everywhere in the midst of the empirical sciences
there is awakening again the interest in philosophy. In the days
of anti-philosophical naturalism scientists believed that philosophy
had come to an end and that an unphilosophical positivism might
be substituted for real philosophy; to-day the mathematicians and
physicists, the chemists and biologists, the historians and economists
eagerly turn again and again to philosophy, and on the borderland
between philosophy and the empirical sciences they seek their most
important problems and discussions. The world begins to feel once
more that all knowledge is empty if it has no inner unity, and that
the inner unity can be brought about only by that science which
enquires into the fundamental conceptions and methods of thought
with which the special sciences work, into the presuppositions and
ultimate axioms with which they begin, into the laws of mental life
which lie at the basis of every experience, into the ways of teaching
the truth, and above all into the value of human knowledge, its absolute
meaning and its relation to all the other human values&mdash;those
of morality, beauty, and religion. The most advanced thinkers of
our time are working to-day in all fields of knowledge to restore
such a unity of human life through philosophy. To foster this spirit
of the twentieth century in the life of our University there is no more
direct way possible than to give a dignified home to the philosophical
work. Such a building ought to be a Harvard Union for scholarly
life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>The beautiful building which we see in our minds should not be
devoted to a single system of philosophy. In its hall we hope to see
as greeting for every student the busts of Plato the Idealist and
Aristotle the Realist, of Descartes and Spinoza, of Bacon and Hobbes,
of Locke and Hume and Berkeley, of Kant and Fichte and Hegel,
of Comte and Spencer, of Helmholtz and Darwin.   The School of
Philosophy will be wide open to all serious thought, as indeed the
members of the Department to-day represent the most various opinions
and convictions. This ought never to be changed; it is the life-condition
of true philosophy.   Yet there is one keynote in all our
work: a serious, critical, lofty idealism which forms the background
of the whole Department and colors our teaching from the elementary
introductions to the researches of our candidates for the doctor's
degree. All the public utterances which have come from the Department
in recent years are filled with this idealism, in spite of the greatest
possible variety of special subjects and special modes of treatment.
Here belong The Will to Believe and the Talks to Teachers, by
William James, the Noble Lectures and the Glory of the Imperfect, by
George Herbert Palmer, Poetry and Religion, by George Santayana,
The Principles of Psychology, and Psychology and Life, by Hugo
MÃ¼nsterberg, Jesus Christ and the Social Question, by Francis Peabody,
Educational Aims and Educational Values, by Paul Hanus,
Shaftesbury, by Benjamin Rand, the Conception of God, and The
World and the Individual, by Josiah Royce.</p>

<p>We have sought a name which might give symbolic expression
to this underlying sentiment of idealism and might thus properly be
connected with the whole building. It cannot be that of a technical
philosopher. Such a name would indicate a prejudice for a special
system of philosophy, while we want above all freedom of thought. It
ought to be an American, to remind the young generation that they
do not live up to the hopes of the School of Philosophy if they simply
learn thoughts imported from other parts of the world, but that
they themselves as young Americans ought to help the growth of
philosophical thought. It ought to be a Harvard man&mdash;a man whose
memory deserves that his name be daily on the lips of our students,
and whose character and whose writing will remain a fountain of
inspiration. Only one man fulfils all these demands perfectly: Ralph
Waldo Emerson. It is our wish and hope that the new, dignified,
beautiful home of philosophy may soon rise as the moral and intellectual
centre of Harvard University and that over its doors we
shall see the name: Emerson Hall&mdash;School of Philosophy.</p>

<h3>III. E<span class="smcapa">MERSON</span> <span class="smcapa">AS</span> P<span class="smcapa">HILOSOPHER</span></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>[The following address was delivered at Harvard University, May, 1903, as
part of the Emerson Celebration:]</p></blockquote>

<p>At the hundredth anniversary of Emerson's birthday, Harvard
University is to take a noble share in the celebration. For years it has
been one of the deepest desires of the Harvard community to erect
in the college yard a building devoted to philosophy only. To-day
this building is secured. To be sure, the good-will of the community
must still do much before the funds allow the erection of a building
spacious enough to fulfil our hopes; but whether the hall shall be
small or large, we know to-day that it will soon stand under the
Harvard elms and that over its door will be inscribed the name:
Ralph Waldo Emerson. No worthier memorial could have been
selected. Orations may be helpful, but the living word flows away;
a statue may be lasting, but it does not awaken new thought. We
shall have orations and we shall have a statue, but we shall have
now, above all, a memorial which will last longer than a monument
and speak louder than an oration: Emerson Hall will be a fountain
of inspiration forever. The philosophical work of Harvard has been
too long scattered in scores of places; there was no unity, philosophy
had no real home. But Emerson Hall will be not only the workshop
of the professional students of philosophy, will be not only the background
for all that manifold activity in ethics and psychology, in
logic and metaphysics, in Ã¦sthetics and sociology, it will become a
new centre for the whole University, embodying in outer form the
mission of philosophy to connect the scattered specialistic knowledge
of the sciences. Harvard could not have offered a more glorious
gift to Emerson's memorial.</p>

<p>But the spirit of such a memorial hour demands, more than all,
sincerity. Can we sincerely say that the choice was wise, when we
look at it from the point of view of the philosophical interests? It
was beautiful to devote the building to Emerson. Was it wise, yes,
was it morally right to devote Emerson's name to the Philosophy
Building? Again and again has such a doubt found expression. Your
building, we have heard from some of the best, belongs to scientific
philosophy; the men who are to teach under its roof are known in
the world as serious scholars, who have no sympathy with the vague
pseudo-philosophy of popular sentimentalists; between the walls of
your hall you will have the apparatus of experimental psychology,
and you will be expected to do there the most critical and most con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>sistent
work in methodology and epistemology. Is it not irony to put
over the door, through which daily hundreds of students are to enter,
the name of a man who may be a poet and a prophet, a leader in
literature and a leader in life, but who certainly was a mystic and not
a thinker, an enthusiast but not a philosopher? Not only those who
belittle him to-day and who short-sightedly deny even his immense
religious influence, but even many of Emerson's warmest admirers
hold such an opinion. They love him, they are inspired by the superb
beauty of his intuitions, but they cannot respect the content of his
ideas, if they do not wish to deny all their modern knowledge and
scientific insight. Yes, for the most part they deny that his ideas form
at all a connected whole; they are aphorisms, beautiful sparks.
Did he not himself say: "With consistency a great soul has simply
nothing to do. He may as well concern himself with his shadow on
the wall." And yet how can there be philosophy without consistency;
how can we interpret reality if we contradict ourselves? If Emerson's
views of the world did really not aim at consistency and did really
ignore our modern knowledge, then it would be better to go on
with our philosophical work in Harvard without shelter and roof
than to have a hall whose name symbolizes both the greatest foe of
philosophy, the spirit of inconsistency, and the greatest danger for
philosophy, the mystic vagueness which ignores real science.</p>

<p>But Emerson stands smiling behind this group of admirers and says,
"To be great is to be misunderstood." Yes, he did say, "A foolish
consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen
and philosophers and divines;" but he soon adds, "Of one will
the actions will be harmonious however unlike they seem." Emerson
despises the consistency of the surface because he holds to the consistency
of the depths, and every sentence he speaks is an action of
the one will, and however unlike they seem they are harmonious, and,
we can add, they are philosophical; and, what may seem to these
anxious friends more daring, they are not only in harmony with each
other, they are in deepest harmony with the spirit of modern philosophy,
with a creed which ought to be taught by the most critical
scholars of Harvard's Philosophy Hall.</p>

<p>What is the essence of Emerson's doctrine in the realm of philosophy?
It seems like sacrilege to formulate anything he said in the
dry terms of technical philosophy. We must tear from it all the richness
and splendor of his style, we must throw off the glory of his metaphor,
and we must leave out his practical wisdom and his religious
emotion. It seems as if we must lose all we love. It is as if we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
to take a painting of Raphael and abstract not only from the richly
colored gowns of the persons in it, but from their flesh and blood,
till only the skeletons of the figures remained. All beauty would be
gone, and yet we know that Raphael himself drew at first the skeletons
of his figures, knowing too well that no pose and no gesture is convincing,
and no drapery beautiful if the bones and joints fit not correctly
together. And such a skeleton of theoretical ideas appears not
only without charm, it appears necessarily also uninteresting, without
originality, commonplace. All the philosophies, from Plato to Hegel,
brought down to their technical formulas, sound merely like new
combinations of trivial elements, and yet they have made the world,
have made revolutions and wars, have led to freedom and peace,
have been mightier than traditions and customs; and it is true for
every one of them that, as Emerson said, "A philosopher must be
more than a philosopher."</p>

<p>There are, it seems, three principles of a philosophical character
without which Emerson's life-work cannot be conceived. To bring
them to the shortest expression we might say, Nature speaks to us;
Freedom speaks in us; the Oversoul speaks through us. There is no
word in Emerson's twelve volumes which is inconsistent with this
threefold conviction, and everything else in his system either follows
immediately from this belief or is a non-essential supplement. But that
threefold faith is a courageous creed indeed. The first, we said, refers
to Nature; he knew Nature in its intimacy, he knew Nature in its
glory; "Give me health and a day and I will make the pomp of
emperors ridiculous." And this Nature, that is the assertion, is not
what natural sciences teach it to be. The Nature of the physicist, the
dead world of atoms controlled by the laws of a dead causality, is not
really the Nature we live in; the reality of Nature cannot be expressed
by the record of its phenomena, but merely by the understanding of
its meaning. Natural science leads us away from Nature as it really
is. We must try to understand the thoughts of Nature. "Nature
stretches out her arms to embrace man; only let his thoughts be of
equal greatness;" and again Emerson says, "All the facts of natural
history taken by themselves have no value, but are barren like a
single sex; but marry it to human history and it is full of life;" and
finally, "The philosopher postpones the apparent order of things to
the empire of Thought."</p>

<p>And in the midst of Nature, of the living Nature, we breathe in
freedom; man is free. Take that away and Emerson is not. Man is
free. He does not mean the freedom of the Declaration of Independence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
a document so anti-Emersonian in its conception of man;
and he does not mean the liberty after which, as he says, the slaves
are crowing while most men are slaves. No, we are free as responsible
agents of our morality. We are free with that freedom which annuls
fate; and if there is fate, then freedom is its most necessary part.
"Forever wells up the impulse of choosing and acting in the soul."
"So far as man thinks he is free." "Before the revelations of the
soul, time, space, and nature shrink away." "Events are grown on
the same stem with the personality; they are sub-personalities."
"We are not built like a ship to be tossed, but like a house to stand."
This freedom alone gives meaning to our life with its duties, and
puts the accent of the world's history on the individual, on the personality:
"All history resolves itself very easily into the biography of a
few stout and earnest persons," and "An institution is the lengthened
shadow of a man."</p>

<p>Nature speaks to us, Freedom speaks in us, but through us speaks
a Soul that is more than individual, an over-individual soul, an "Oversoul,
within which every man is contained and made one with all
others." Now even "Nature is a great shadow, pointing always to
the sun behind her." Every one of us belongs to an absolute consciousness
which in us and through us wills its will; "Men descend
to meet" and "Jove nods to Jove from behind each of us." Yes,
"Man is conscious of a universal soul within or behind his individual
life, wherein as in a firmament justice, truth, love, freedom arise and
shine." The ideals, the duties, the obligations, are not man's will but
the will of an Absolute.</p>

<p>Does not all this sound like a wilful denial of all that has been
fixed by the sciences of our time? Does not every Sophomore who
has had his courses in Physics, Psychology, and Sociology know
better? He knows, we all know, that the processes of Nature stand
under physical laws, that the will of man is the necessary outcome of
psychological laws, that the ideals of man are the products of human
civilization and sociological laws. And if every atom in the universe
moves according to the laws which physics and chemistry, astronomy
and geology, have discovered, is it not anti-scientific sentimentality
to seek a meaning and thoughts in the mechanical motions of the dead
world of substance? So the poet may speak, but we ought not to say
that his fanciful dreams have value for scholarly philosophers. The
philosophy of the scientist ought to be the acknowledgment that
matter and energy, and space and time are eternal, and that the
smallest grain of sand and the largest solar system move meaningless
by blind causality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>And emptier still is the naÃ¯ve belief that man is free. Do we not
profit from decades of psychological labor, whereby the finest structure
of the brain has been discovered, wherein the psychological laws
have been studied with the exactitude of a natural science, wherein
we have studied the mental life of animals and children, and have
observed the illusions of freedom in the hypnotized man and in the
insane? Yes, we know to-day that every mental act, that every
psychological process is the absolutely necessary outcome of the
given circumstances; that the functions of the cells in the cortex of
the brain determine every decision and volition, and that man's deed
is as necessary as the falling of the stone when its support is taken
away. Yes, modern psychology does not even allow the will as an
experience of its own kind; it has shown with all the means of its
subtle analysis that all which we feel as our will is only a special combination
of sensations which accompany certain movement-impulses
in our body. Can we still take it seriously, when the philosopher steps
in and pushes sovereignly aside all the exact knowledge of mankind,
and declares simply "Man's will is free!"</p>

<p>Finally, the claim for the over-personal, absolute consciousness in
man. It is a triumph of modern science to understand how the duties
and ideals have grown up in the history of civilization. What one
nation calls moral is perhaps indifferent or immoral for another people
or for another time; what the one calls beautiful is ugly for the other;
what one period admires as truth is absurdity for another; there is
no absolute truth, no absolute beauty, no absolute religion, no absolute
morality; and sociology shows how it was necessary that just
these ideals and just these obligations should have grown up under
a given climate and soil, a given temperament of the race, a given set
of economical conditions, a given accumulation of technical achievements.
Man has made his Absolute, not the Absolute made man,
and whatever hopes and fears make men believe, the scholarly mind
cannot doubt that these beliefs and idealizations are merely the
products of the feelings and emotions of individuals bound together
by equal conditions of life. Leave it to the raptures of the mystic
to ignore all scientific truth, to get over-soul connection beyond all
experience. In short, to accept Emerson's philosophy, the scientist
would say, means to be a poet where Nature is concerned, means to
be ignorant where man is concerned, and means to be a mystic where
moral and religious, aesthetic and logical ideals are concerned. Can
such be the herald of modern philosophy?</p>

<p>But those who are so proud and so quick are not aware that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
times have changed and that their speech is the wisdom of yesterday.
In the history of human knowledge the periods alternate. Great
waves follow each other, and while one tendency of scientific thought
is ebbing, another is rising; and there is no greater alternation than
that between positivism and idealism. The positivistic period of
natural science has ebbed for ten or fifteen years; an idealistic one
is rising. Emerson once said here in Harvard that the Church has
periods when it has wooden chalices and golden priests, and others
when it has golden chalices and wooden priests. That is true for the
churches of human knowledge too, and for knowledge of all denominations.
Forty, fifty years ago, in the great period when Helmholtz
discovered the conservation of energy and Darwin the origin of species,
one naturalistic triumph followed the other, golden high priests of
natural science were working with wooden chalices in narrow,
awkward laboratories; to-day natural science has golden chalices
provided in luxurious institutions, but there are too many wooden
priests. The fullest energies of our time are pressing on to an idealistic
revival, are bringing about a new idealistic view of the world, and
turning in sympathy to that last foregoing period of idealism of which
Ralph Waldo Emerson was perhaps the last original exponent. But
also with his period idealism was not new. When he came to speak
on the Transcendentalist, he began, "The first thing we have to say
respecting the new views here in New England is that they are not
new." Yes, indeed; since the beginnings of Greek philosophy,
more than two thousand years ago, the two great tendencies have
constantly followed each other. Each one must have its time of development,
must reach its climax, must go over into undue exaggeration,
and thus destroy itself to make room for the other, which then
begins in its turn to grow, to win, to overdo, and to be defeated.</p>

<p>Glorious had been the triumph of Positivism in the middle of the
eighteenth century when the French encyclopÃ¦dists were at work,
those men who wrote the decrees for the French Revolution. But
before the last consequences of the Positivism of the eighteenth century
were drawn, the idealistic counter-movement had started. Immanuel
Kant gave the signal, he fired the shot heard round the world;
and Fichte followed, whose ethical Idealism changed the map of
Europe, and his spirit went over the Channel to Carlyle, and finally
over the ocean to these shores of New England and spoke with the
lips of Emerson. It is unimportant whether Emerson studied the
great transcendental systems in the original; he knew Kant and
Schelling probably at first through Coleridge, and Fichte through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
Carlyle. But in the mean time Idealism too had exaggerated its claims,
it had gone forward to Hegel, and while Hegelian thought, about
1830, held in an iron grasp the deepest knowledge of his time, his
neglect of positive experience demanded reaction, a counter-movement
became necessary, and in the midst of the nineteenth century the
great idealistic movement with all its philosophical and historical
energies went down, and a new Positivism, full of enthusiasm for
natural science and technique and full of contempt for philosophy,
gained the day. With logical consistency, the spirit of empiricism
went from realm to realm. It began with the inorganic world,
passed into physics, then forward to chemistry, became more ambitious
and conquered the world of organisms, and when biology had
said its positivistic say, turned from the outer nature of being to the
inner nature. The mind of man was scrutinized with positivistic
methods; we came to experimental psychology, and finally, as the
highest possible aim of naturalism, to the positivistic treatment of
society as a whole, to sociology. But naturalism again has overdone
its mission, the world has begun to feel that all the technique and all
the naturalistic knowledge makes life not more worth living, that
comfort and bigness do not really mean progress, that naturalism
cannot give us an ultimate view of the world. And above all, the
reaction has come from the midst of the sciences themselves. Twenty
years ago scientific work received its fullest applause for the neglect
of philosophical demands. Ten years ago the feeling came up that
there are after all problems which need philosophy, and to-day
philosophers, with good or bad philosophy, are at work everywhere.
The physicists, the chemists and the biologists, the astronomers and
the mathematicians, the psychologists and the sociologists, the historians
and the economists, the linguists and the jurists, all are
to-day busily engaged in philosophical enquiries, in enquiries into the
conditions of their knowledge, into the presuppositions and methods
of their sciences, into their ultimate principles and conceptions; in
short, without a word of sudden command, the front has changed its
direction. We are moving again towards philosophy, towards Idealism,
towards Emerson.</p>

<p>Does all this mean that we are to forget the achievements of natural
science, and ignore the results of empirical labor, of labor which
has given us an invincible mastery of stubborn nature and an undreamed-of
power to calculate all processes of the physical and of
the psychical world? No sane man can entertain such a notion. Yes,
such ideas would contradict the laws which have controlled the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
alternation of Idealism and Positivism through the ages of the past.
Whenever Positivism returned, it always showed a new face, and the
teaching of the intervening period of Idealism was never lost. The
naturalism of the middle of the nineteenth century was not at all
identical with the naturalism of the middle of the eighteenth; and so
Idealism too, as often as it returned to mankind after periods of neglect
and contempt, had every time gained in meaning, had every
time found increased responsibilities, had every time to do justice to
the new problems which the preceding period of Positivism had raised.
If Idealism to-day wants to gain new strength, nothing must be lost of
all that the last fifty years have brought us, no step must be taken
backward, the careful scientific work of the specialists must be encouraged
and strengthened, and yet the totality of this work must be
brought under new aspects which allow a higher synthesis; yes,
a higher synthesis is the problem of the philosopher of to-day. He
does not want to be ignorant of natural science and simply to substitute
idealistic demands in the place of solid, substantial facts; and
he should feel ashamed of the foul compromise with which half-thinkers
are easily satisfied, a compromise which allows science its own way
till it comes over the boundaries of human emotions, a compromise
which accepts rigid causality but pierces little holes in the causal
world, making little exceptions here and there that human freedom
may be saved in the midst of a world-machinery; a compromise
which accepts the social origin of ideals, but claims a mystic knowledge
that just our own private pattern will remain in fashion for
eternity. No philosophy can live by compromises. If natural science
is to be accepted and Idealism is to hold its own, they must be combined,
they must form a synthesis in which the one no longer contradicts
the other. Just such synthetic harmonization, and not at all
a stubborn ignorance of the other side or a compromise with cheap
concessions, was the aim of the period from Kant to Emerson. It
is merely the naturalistic period which ignores its idealistic counterpart,
which delights in its one-sidedness, which is afraid of harmony
because it is suspicious of demands for concessions. It is naturalism
only which thinks that mankind can walk on one leg.</p>

<p>If we ask where such harmonization can be found, where the great
Idealists of the beginning of the last century have sought it, and
where our modern philosophy is seeking it again, well aware that by
the progress of science in the mean time the difficulties have been
multiplied, the logical responsibilities have become gigantic, we
cannot do more here than to point out the direction; we cannot go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
the way. And it is clear, of course, too, that such an answer has its
individual shape, and that no one can promise to give a bird's-eye
view of the marching movement while he is himself marching among
his comrades. But the individual differences are non-essential. The
one great tendency, the Emersonian spirit, if it is rightly understood,
is common to them all. What has modern philosophy all over the
world to say about that threefold claim concerning Nature, Freedom,
and Oversoul? What has it to say when natural science has fully
said its say and had its fair hearing, and has been approved as sound
and welcome?</p>

<p>A philosopher might answer, perhaps, as follows: You Positivists
have done wonderfully with your microscopes and your telescopes,
with your chronoscopes and spectroscopes; you have measured
and weighed and analyzed and described, and finally explained the
whole world which you perceive, and there is nothing in space and
time and causality which can escape your search. But did not all that
work of yours involve certain presuppositions which you had accepted
and which it was not your business to look on critically, but which,
nevertheless, may be open to enquiry? Your first claims granted,
all may follow; but how is it with the first claims? You examine
all that is in space and time, but what are space and time? You
examine the material substances and the contents of consciousness,
but what is consciousness, and what is matter? You seek the special
applications of causality, but what is causality? Well, you reply, you
give the facts just as you find them; but do you do that really? And
what do you mean by saying that you find the facts? Let us look, at
least for a moment, at the very simplest facts with which your work
begins. You say there are physical objects made up of atoms, and
you describe them as a physicist; and there are mental ideas in consciousness
made up of sensations, and you describe them as a psychologist;
and both, you say, you are finding. But what does it mean,
that you find the physical object outside there and the mental idea
of the object inside in you; is that really a statement of your immediate
experience? The physicist speaks of this table here before me,
outside of me; and the psychologist speaks of my idea of this table,
enclosed in my consciousness. Both may do well to speak so; but will
you make me believe that I find that doubleness in my experience?
If I see this table and want to use it, I am not aware of one table
of wooden stuff and another in me of mental stuff. I am not aware of
a two-ness at all, and if the physicist says that this wooden table is
made up of molecules and has in itself no color and no continuity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
and that the mental idea in me furnishes all those qualities of color
and smoothness, but has no solidity, then they speak of two interesting
worlds about which I am anxious to know, but certainly neither
of them is the world I live in. If I lean on this table I am not aware
of a table in my mind at all. I know the one table only, and this one
table has its color and its smoothness.</p>

<p>I know what you will answer. You will say, in your immediate
experience there are indeed not two worlds of objects, a physical
and a psychical; the real thing to which our interests in life refer is
not differentiated into a molecular object outside of us and a sensational
object in us, but it is clear that every real thing allows a kind
of double aspect; we can consider this table in so far as it is common
to all of us, in so far as it is a possible object for every one of us, and in
so far as it becomes an object for the individual, and we can then call
the objects, in so far as they are common property, physical; and in
so far as we take the aspect of individual relations, psychical; and
as it must be of the highest importance for our practical purposes to
discriminate between those two aspects, we have clearly the right
to consider the world from the point of view of both the physicist
and the psychologist. It is, of course, an abstraction if we leave out
in the one case the one side, in the other case the other side of our
objective experience; but we gain by that the possibility of constructing
two closed causal systems of which each one must have its special
conditions of existence, inasmuch as the one is conceived as related
to individuals and the other as independent of individuals.</p>

<p>Very true, we should answer. Something like that saves you completely,
justifies fully your claim to separate the physical and the
psychical worlds of objects, the world of matter and the world of
ideas; but can you deny that you have lost your case, are you not
now yourself in the midst of philosophical, methodological discussions,
which your physics and psychology themselves cannot settle,
yet which must be settled before they can enter into their rights;
and above all, do you not yourself see now that your whole physics,
for instance, is not at all an account of reality, but merely a certain
logical transformation of reality; that you do not find the world of
physics at all, just as little as you find the psychical ideas, but that
you can merely work over and reshape the reality which you find till
you construct out of it your world of matter and your world of consciousness?
What you believed you would find you have never
found, while your construction of physical things may have been most
necessary for your purposes; but do not deny that you have left
reality far behind you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>And so it is with all your doings. You tell us proudly, for instance,
that you show us the deepest nature of the world by showing us the
elements which the object contains, and that you thus bring us at
least nearer to the essence of things; and yet if we begin to look into
your real achievements, we are disappointed again to find that you
are far away from even attempting anything of the kind. You tell
us that water is hydrogen and oxygen, and if we say "Prove it,"
you show us simply that you can transform the water into hydrogen
and oxygen, and that you can transform these two elements again
into water. Is that really what you promise? We want to know
what the thing is, and you show us simply how the one thing can be
transformed into another thing; and whenever we turn to your
wisdom, it is always the same story. You show us always, and most
nicely, how the one goes over into the other, but you never show us
what the one or the other really is in itself. For your practical purposes
the first may be the most important aspect, but do not make us
believe, therefore, that it is the only possible aspect. In short, whether
science describes or explains, it never gives us what we find in reality,
but makes out of reality a new ideal construction in the service of
certain purposes, and never gives us the things as they are, but merely
the effects and changes which they produce. Are we still, then, to be
deeply impressed with the claim of the naturalist that he alone has
the monopoly of knowing reality, while we see now that every step
of his leads us away from reality? And have we still to be afraid to
raise the voice as philosophers with the claim that reality itself must
find its expression, that there must be a science which shall give account
of reality as we really find it, of nature before it is made up
and repolished for the purposes of the physicist? Only if we have
such other account of nature, then only do we speak of that nature in
which we live and in which we act, and compared with such an account
of the fuller reality, the constructed schematism of the physicist must
appear, indeed, as Emerson said, "barren like a single sex." Not
the slightest result of natural science is depreciated, not the slightest
discovery ignored, if we insist that all these so-called facts have a
meaning only under certain artificial conditions which set them apart
from the reality of our life; and in this reality lies the interest of the
philosopher. We have thus no reason to reproach the scientist so long
as the scientist does not fancy that his science gives an account of
nature as it really is. Both kinds of work are necessary, and the
scientist may well speak, as the squirrel in Emerson's poem:</p>

<p>Natural science has to crack our nuts, but philosophy has to carry
on its back the flourishing forests of life, in which we wander and
breathe. And if Emerson is right, to-day and forever, in claiming
that the facts of natural science are not expressions of reality, it is only
a small step to see that he was not less right in saying that man is
free. Consider man as a particle in the physical universe, consider
his actions from the point of view of a causal science, and there is
no possibility of escaping materialism and fatalism. We must understand
every activity as a necessary outcome of foregoing conditions.
Psychology must do so, and physics must do the same. The empirical
sciences would be disloyal to their own principles if they allowed
the slightest exception. The noblest gesture, the greatest word, the
bravest action, must be considered by them under the category of
causality. They are necessary effects of all the preceding causes. It
may be interesting, it may be fascinating to follow such lines with the
enthusiastic energy of scholarly research. But are we really obliged
to accept the outcome as an ultimate word concerning the meaning
of our freedom? "Forever wells up the impulse of choosing and acting
in the soul." Is it really merely an illusion? Has responsibility still
its moral value, are we the actors of our actions, are we still good,
are we still guilty, when every deed follows as necessary effect? Is
not, then, the whole constitution of the world, which has made us,
responsible whenever we move our hand for good or for bad?</p>

<p>But we know now where we are standing; we know now that the
world of objects, of psychical as well as of physical, is a constructed
world, constructed for the purpose of satisfying our demand for causal
connection; for that world holds causality because it is the world seen
from the point of view of causality; and just as there cannot be
anything in that world of physical and psychical objects which is not
causally connected, just so it cannot have any meaning at all to ask
for causal connection before the world is conceived in the service
of this artificial construction. Reality in itself is not causal, and to
ask for the causes of the real experience of our inner life has not more
meaning than to ask how many pounds is the weight of a virtue, and
how many inches is the length of our hopes. But we must go farther.
To apply the question of cause and effect to our real will means not
only that we apply to the real object a standard which belongs to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
artificial or constructed object, but it means above all that we consider
as an object something which in reality is not an object at all.
The will which the psychologist describes and must describe, the
will which has causes and which is thus not free, is a will conceived as
an object found in our mind like an idea, something of which we are
aware, something whose happening we perceive, and yet if anything
is sure it is the immediate experience that we are aware of our will in
a way which is absolutely different from the way in which we perceive
objects. We do not perceive our will at all, we will it, we strive it, we
fight it; yes, we feel ourselves, only in so far as we are the subjects of
will. Our will is our personality, which we do not find but which
we are, and which stands opposed and separated by the deepest
gulf from the world of objects. Those objects are means and purposes
of our will, are ends and aims and instruments; but they come
in question for us only as we will them, as we like and dislike them,
as we approve and reject them. And if we take this world of objects
and reconstruct it into the artificial world of physical and psychical
things connected by causality, in this very act of reconstruction we
feel ourselves as willing, deciding, approving, aiming personalities,
whose wills decide, who think the world as causally connected,
whose freedom guarantees the value of our conception of a world
not free. There is no knowledge but in our judgments; there is no
judgment but in our affirming and denying; there is no affirming
and denying but in our will. Our will chooses for its purposes to conceive
reality as if it were unfree. What a climax of confusion to think
that this conception of an unfree world, the conception of science,
can itself now condemn the freedom of the will which has chosen.
"Freedom is necessary," said Emerson. We can add, necessity itself
is merely a purpose determined by freedom. "Intellect annuls fate,"
Emerson says. We may add, fate is merely an idea of intellect. Let
us be psychologists if we want to analyze, to calculate, to explain
the unfree man; but let us be philosophers to understand what it
means to be a psychologist. Now the synthesis is reached; the real
world is free, but we choose for our purposes to conceive the world
as unfree, and thus to construct causal sciences.</p>

<p>And if we understand that in reality man is free and that the
psychological aspect of man as unfree is a special way of looking
on man for special purposes, then suddenly there opens itself before
us the vast field of history, and the historical life, which seemed
deprived of all interest by the psychological, iconoclastic mood, suddenly
wins again a new importance. We feel instinctively that this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
free man of reality, this man who is a responsible actor of his actions,
he only is the agent of history; and history is falsified and cheapened
when it is brought down to a causal explanation of psychological
man instead of real man. History had become an appendix
of sociology, and what great historians aimed at in the interpretation
of the few "stout and earnest personalities" seemed lost in
favor of a construction in which the great man and the genius
rank with the fool as mere extreme variations of psychological averages.
Now suddenly do we understand that history has to deal with
the world of freedom, that it has not to explain, but to interpret,
that it has not to connect the facts by linking causes and effects,
but by understanding the meaning of purposes, their agreement
and disagreement, their growth and liberty. Now we understand
why Fichte, why Carlyle, why Emerson believes in heroes and hero-worship,
why Idealism has been at all times the fertile ground for
writing history and for making history, while Naturalism has made
technique, and thought in an anti-historical spirit. Our time begins
again to think historically. It can do so because it again begins to
emancipate itself from its positivistic disbelief in man's freedom and
from its unphilosophic superstition that causal science alone is science,
that we know only when we explain.</p>

<p>And when we at last stand man to man in full freedom, no longer
as psycho-physical constructions but as free personalities, and when
we debate and try to convince each other, will you deny that Jove
stands behind each of us and Jove nods to Jove when we meet?
Would it even have a meaning for us to go on with our talk, should
we try at all to convince each other if you thought and I thought,
each one for himself, that our will is only our personal will, that there
is no over-individual will, no Oversoul behind us? Can we discuss at
all if we do not presuppose that there is really a truth which we are
seeking in common, that there are certain judgments which we are
bound to will, which we are obliged to affirm, which we will, but not
as individuals, and of which we take for granted that every one whom
we acknowledge at all as a personality must will them too; and if
you come with the flippant air of the sceptic and tell me, "No,
there is no truth, all is only as it appears to me, there is no objective
truth," do you not contradict yourself, are you not saying that at
least this, your own statement, expresses objective truth; that you
will this with a faith and belief that this will of yours is an over-individual
will which is, as such, a duty, an obligation for every one
who thinks? Every escape is futile. And all the over-individuality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
that lives in our will towards truth comes to us again in our will
towards morality. Do not say sceptically that there is no absolute obligation,
that you do not feel bound by an over-individual will in your
action, that you will do in every moment what pleases you individually.
You cannot even speak this sceptical word without contradicting
yourself again, as you demand through the fact of your saying it that
we believe that you speak the truth and that you thus feel yourself
bound not to lie. If you leave us doubtful whether your word was not
a lie, the word itself cannot have any meaning. Do not try to dodge
the Oversoul. Men live and fight in its purposes, and men descend
to meet. It is as Emerson said, "At first delighted with the triumph
of the intellect, we are like hunters on the scent and soldiers who
rush to battle; but when the game is run down, when the enemy
lies cold in his blood at our feet, we are alarmed at our solitude."
Let the sociologists triumphantly reduce the ideals to necessary
social products of evolution in the same spirit in which the psychologist
eliminates the freedom of the individual; but let us never forget
that such a social mechanism is as much an artificial construction
necessary for its purposes as is the psycho-physical mechanism of
individuality. In that reality with which history deals, in which our
freedom lies, there our over-individual will comes from deeper ground
than from the soil and the food and the climate. Our logical obligations,
our ethical duties, our Ã¦sthetic appreciations, our religious
revelations, in reality they do not come from without, they come
from within; but from within as far as we are souls in the Oversoul.
There is no duty in the world but the duty which we will ourselves;
no outer force, no training, no custom, no punishment can make
us have duties. Duty is our will, it may be the duty to think for the
ideal of truth, the duty to feel for the ideal of Ã¦sthetics, the duty to
act for the idea of morality, the duty to have faith in the ideal of religion;
but it is always our own will, and yet not our fanciful, personal,
individual will. It is a system of purposes upon whose reality all
knowledge of the world, and thus the world as we know it, is dependent
forever. The wave of Idealism is rising. The short-sighted superstition
of Positivism will not lurk under the roof of a new hall of
philosophy. To be a true student of the most scientific, of the most
scholarly, of the most insistent philosophy means to respect and to
study the sciences, the physical and the psychical sciences, but at
the same time to understand that natural science is not the science
of reality, that psychology does not touch the freedom of man, that
no life has a meaning without the relation to the Oversoul. We cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
write a whole system and a whole text-book on the front of the new
building. It must be enough to write there a symbolic word; happy,
forever happy, the university which can write over the door of its
temple of philosophy the name: Ralph Waldo Emerson.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[At the opening of Emerson Hall, December 27, 1905, the American Psychological
Association discussed the relation of psychology to philosophy; I opened
the discussion with the following remarks:]</p></blockquote>

<p>From the whole set of problems which cluster about psychology
and its relation to neighboring sciences, this hour, in which Emerson
Hall is completed, and this room, in which I hope to teach psychology
to the end of my life, suggest to me most forcibly to-day the one
question: Have I been right in housing psychology under this roof?
I might have gone to the avenue yonder and might have begged
for a psychological laboratory in the spacious quarters of the Agassiz
Museum, to live there in peaceful company with the biologists; or
I might have persuaded our benefactors to build for me a new wing
of the physical laboratory. But I insisted that the experimental
psychologists feel at home only where logic and ethics, metaphysics
and epistemology keep house on the next floor.</p>

<p>I certainly do not mean that the psychologist ought to mix the
records of his instruments with the demands of his speculations, and
that he may seek help from the Absolute when the figures of the
chronoscope or the curves of the kymograph are doubtful. Experimental
psychology is certainly to-day and will be for all future an
independent exact discipline with its own problems and methods.
No one can insist more earnestly than I do on the demarcation line
between the empirical study of mental phenomena and the logical
enquiry into the values of life.</p>

<p>Yet I deny that it is a personal idiosyncrasy of mine to try to combine
vivid interest in both. There is no antagonism between them;
a man may love both his mother and his bride. I am devoted to
philosophy, just as I love my native country; and I am devoted
to psychology, just as I love the country in which I do my daily
work; I feel sure there is no reason for any friction between them.</p>

<p>Of course, on the surface a psychological laboratory has much
more likeness to the workshop of the physicist. But that has to do
with externalities only. The psychologist and the physicist alike
use subtle instruments, need dark rooms and sound-proof rooms, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
are spun into a web of electric wires. And yet the physicist has never
done anything else than to measure his objects, while I feel sure
that no psychologist has ever measured a psychical state. Psychical
states are not quantities, and every so-called measurement thereof
refers merely to their physical accompaniments and conditions. The
world of mental phenomena is a world of qualities, in which one is
never a multiple of the other, and the deepest tendencies of physics
and psychology are thus utterly divergent.</p>

<p>The complicated apparatus is therefore not an essential for the
psychologist. Of course, we shall use every corner of our twenty-four
laboratory-rooms upstairs, and every instrument in the new cases&mdash;and
yet much of our most interesting work is done without any
paraphernalia. Three of the doctor-dissertations which our psychological
laboratory completed last year consisted of original research in
which no instruments were involved; they dealt with memory-images,
with associations, with Ã¦sthetic feeling, and so on. Yes, when, a
short time ago, a Western university asked me how much it would
cost to introduce a good practical training-course in experimental
psychology, I replied that it would cost them the salary of a really
good psychologist, and besides, perhaps, one dollar for cardboard,
strings, rulers, colored paper, wire, and similar fancy articles at five
cents apiece.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I do not know a psychological experiment which
does not need a philosophical background to bring its results into
sharp relief. Of course, you will say, the psychologist deals with
facts, not with theories, and has to analyze and to describe and to
explain those facts. Certainly he has to do all that; only he must
not forget that the so-called "fact" in psychology is the product of
complex transformations of reality. A will, an emotion, a memory-image,
a feeling, an act of attention, of judgment, of decision&mdash;these
are not found in the way in which stones and stars are noticed.
Even if I choose perceptions or sensations as material for my psychological
study, and still more when I call them <em>my</em> perceptions and
<em>my</em> sensations, I mean something which I have found at the end of
a long logical road, not at its starting-point, and that road certainly
leads through philosophy. Emerson said wisely, "A philosopher
must be more than a philosopher;" we can add: A psychologist
must be more than a psychologist. First of all, he must be a philosopher.</p>

<p>What would be the result if our laboratory had moved to the
naturalistic headquarters? It would be the beginning of a complete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
separation from philosophy. Our graduate students would flock
to psychological research work without even being aware that without
philosophical training they are mere dilettantes. And soon
enough a merely psychological doctorate would be demanded. I do
not deny at all that such pure psychologists would find enough to
do; I should doubt only whether they know what they are doing.
There are too many psychologists already who go their way so undisturbed
only because they walk like somnambulists on the edge
of the roof; they do not even see the real problem; they do not see
the depths to which they may fall.</p>

<p>But does the laboratory itself gain from such divorce? Just the
contrary. It is evident that everywhere in the world where the psychological
laboratory turns to natural science, the experiments deal
mostly with sensation, perception, and reaction; while those laboratories
which keep their friendship with epistemology emphasize
the higher mental functions, experimenting on attention, memory,
association, feeling, emotion, thought, and so on. But is it not clear
that only the latter work gives to the psychological laboratory a real
right to existence, as the former is almost completely overlapped by
the well-established interests of the physiologists? If psychology
cannot do anything else than that which physiologists like Helmholtz,
Hering, Kries, Mach, Bowditch, and the rest have always
done so successfully, then experimental psychology had better give
up the trade and leave the study of the mind to the students of the
organism.</p>

<p>I have said that we ought not to depend on authorities here. Yet
one name, I think, ought to be mentioned gratefully in this hour
in which the new psychological laboratory is opened for work. I
think of Professor Wundt of Leipzig. The directors of the psychological
laboratories in Columbia, and Yale, in Clark and Chicago,
in Pennsylvania and Cornell, in Johns Hopkins and Washington, in
Leland Stanford and Harvard, and many more are his pupils. Some
weeks ago, when I did not foresee our present discussion, I told him
of Emerson Hall; and a few days ago I got an answer from which,
as my closing word, I may quote in translation. Professor Wundt
writes to me: "I am especially glad that you affiliated your new
psychological laboratory to philosophy, and that you did not migrate
to the naturalists. There seems to be here and there a tendency to
such migration, yet I believe that psychology not only now, but for
all time, belongs to philosophy: only then can psychology keep its
necessary independence." Mr. Chairman, these are the words of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
father of experimental psychology.   I hope they indicate the policy
to which Harvard University will adhere forever.</p>

<p>A monumental staircase leads from the first&mdash;the lecture-room&mdash;floor
of Emerson Hall to the second, the library floor; at the two
ends of its broad corridor smaller staircases lead to the third floor,
the laboratory. Its general division of space is seen at a glance from
the sketch of the ground plan (opposite page 1). Eighteen rooms
of various sizes with outside windows form a circle around the central
hall which is well lighted by large skylights; but at each end of the
hall itself two large windowless spaces are cut off and each of these
is divided into three dark rooms. We have thus twenty-four rooms,
besides coat-room, toilet-rooms, etc. A further stair leads to the
wide attic which is mainly a store-room for the institution.</p>

<p>In order that the laboratory should be adaptable to the most
diverse purposes, the permanent differentiation of the rooms has
been kept in narrow limits. It seemed unwise to give from the
first every room to a special line of research, as the preponderance
of special interests may frequently shift; there are years when perhaps
studies in physiological and comparative psychology make
the largest demand and others in which studies in Ã¦sthetical and
educational psychology stand in the foreground. A thorough-going
specialization, by which special rooms are reserved for tactual studies
and others for chronoscope work or for kymograph researches,
allows of course certain conveniences in the fixed arrangement of
instruments and a certain elaboration of equipment that is built
in, but it very much impairs the flexibility of the whole laboratory,
and has thus not seemed advisable for an institution whose catholic
attitude welcomes investigations as different as those contained in
this volume.</p>

<p>To be sure certain constant requirements have demanded a special
fitting up of one room as a workshop, one room for the more delicate
instruments, one for the beginning course in experimental work,
a lecture-room for the courses in comparative psychology, a photography-room,
a battery-room, a sound-proof room, the chief animal
rooms, and the dark rooms. We have seven light-proof rooms, finished
in black, of which two have outside windows for heliostats;
of the others, four can be used for optical research; the longest one
contains the photometer. Six other rooms, including the lecture-room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
may be darkened by opaque blinds. One contains a partition
with door and a grooved window-frame fitted with screens in which
openings of any desired size and shape may be cut. This window is
opposite the main door of the room, and opposite this, across the
central hall, some sixty feet away, is the door of another dark room;
optical stimuli can thus be given from this window to a subject over
seventy feet away.</p>

<p>Several rooms are fitted up with special reference to the investigation
of the various forms of organic movement, animal behavior
and intelligence. As one result of several investigations in animal
psychology already pursued here, the laboratory has a considerable
number of devices for testing and making statistical studies of the
senses and intelligence, methods of learning and emotional reactions
of animals.</p>

<p>Adequate provision is made for the keeping of animals in a large,
well-lighted, and well-ventilated corner room. Instead of having
aquaria built into the room, an aquarium-table eighteen feet long has
been constructed to support moveable aquaria of various sizes.
Whenever it is desirable for the purposes of an investigation, any of
these aquaria may be moved to the research-room of the investigator
or to such quarters as the special conditions of the experiment demand.</p>

<p>The vivarium-room contains, in addition to provisions for water-inhabiting
animals, cages of a variety of forms and sizes. The largest
of these cages, six and a half feet high, six feet wide, and four feet
deep, may be used for birds, monkeys, or any of the medium-sized
mammals. Cages for rabbits, guinea-pigs, and other small animals
are arranged in frames which support four double compartments.
Similarly, small cages suitable for mice, rats, and other small rodents
are in supporting frames which carry four of the double cages, each
of which is removeable and may be carried to the experimenting-room
at the convenience of the experimenter.</p>

<p>In a large unheated room above the main laboratory are tanks
for amphibians and reptiles. These tanks, since they can be kept
at a low temperature during the winter, are very convenient and
useful for frogs, tortoises, and similar hibernating animals.</p>

<p>In view of the prime importance of electricity to a modern psychological
laboratory, a rather elaborate system of wiring has been
designed and built in. The unit of this system is a small delivery-board
six inches wide by eight inches high, which carries the following five
circuits: <em>a</em>, a time-circuit for running magnetic signals; <em>bb</em>, two low-tension
circuits for chronoscope, bells, signals, etc.; <em>c</em>, a high-tension<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
alternating current (110 v. and 60 phases) for alt. current motors,
to be used where great constancy of speed is desired; <em>d</em>, a high-tension
direct current (110 v.) for dir. current motors, where it is desired to
vary the speed continuously (by the introduction of resistance).
Two such delivery-boards have been set on opposite walls of all except
the smallest rooms, which have but one board. Circuits <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> are
represented on the board by binding-posts, while the high-tension
currents, <em>c</em> and <em>d</em>, appear as flush, protected sockets that take a
double-pole plug.</p>

<p>Circuit <em>a</em> is a single circuit led from a time-pendulum permanently
set in the battery-room, and carried once around the laboratory.
It is connected with the <em>a</em> binding-posts of the individual delivery-boards
in parallel. It follows that the time-circuit is alike for all the
rooms at any one time; but in different hours the pendulum can be
adjusted to give various impulse-rates. If an investigation requires
some special rate of impulse, the special time-apparatus is set up in
the investigator's room and current for it taken from one of the <em>b</em>
pairs of posts.</p>

<p>Each <em>b</em> pair goes directly from the delivery-board to the battery-room
and ends at a double-pole (telephone type) socket on a large
switch-board. Thus every room has two or four direct and independent
connections with the battery-room.</p>

<p>The <em>c</em> and <em>d</em> circuits do not come from the battery-room, but
from their respective generators that are stationed outside of the
building. They are of course connected at the delivery-boards in
parallel.</p>

<p>The large switch-board in the battery-room consists of an upper
and a lower part. The upper part bears the double-pole sockets
from the <em>b</em> posts in all the rooms; the lower part carries some fifty
pairs of single-pole sockets that are connected with the batteries
stationed near by. These pairs are labelled, and some give a current
from cells of the LeclanchÃ© type, others of a gravity type. The
student has merely to choose the kind and number of cells that he
needs, from the lower part, and connect them with one of the double-pole
sockets of the upper part which runs to a <em>b</em> pair in his own room.
By connecting two double-pole sockets with each other, the student
can establish a circuit between any two rooms of the laboratory,&mdash;this
for purposes of telephonic or other communication. Since every
room has two, and most of the rooms have four of the <em>b</em> circuits,
the greatest variety and elasticity of service is attained.</p>

<p>The large switch-board further carries a voltmetre and an ammetre,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
both of the Weston make, which are reached (electrically)
from double-pole jacks (sockets) on the upper part of the board.
Thus before connecting the current with his room, the student can
in a moment measure its amount and intensity. These instruments
are of the flushface type, and dead-beat.</p>

<p>All of the rooms are lighted by electricity, and the lighting system
is independent of the delivery-boards. Nine of the rooms are provided
with soapstone sinks, and six (not including the lavatories and
service-room) with enamelled iron or porcelain sinks. All the sinks
have two taps and each of these ends with a screw-thread so as to take
a tip and rubber hose. The soapstone sinks were specially designed
with soapstone drip-boards. This is probably the best material for
a research-room, and the porcelain and enamel sinks were put only
where a neater appearance was desired, or where chemicals were
to be frequently used&mdash;as for instance in the battery and photographic
rooms. Gas is not used for illumination, but six rooms are
provided with jets for the smoking of drums, soldering, brazing, etc.</p>

<p>The instrument-room is equipped with large dust-proof cases
for holding the more delicate and valuable instruments. The larger
unused pieces are stored, out of sight but readily accessible, in an
attic which has a clear floor-space of something more than half the
total area of the laboratory. Dust-proof cases for demonstration
and class-work material are provided in the lecture- and class-rooms.</p>

<p>The shop contains a wood-working bench with two vices, tool-racks,
shelves, drawers, cupboards, and stock-racks, for the use of
students; and a 9-in. lathe, circular saw, grinding- and buffing-machine,
separate bench, vice, racks, and drawers for the use of the
mechanic. The machinery is run by a 5 h.p. electric motor suspended
from one of the outside brick walls, on brackets. One who
selects the equipment of such a shop has to weigh carefully the
respective merits of circular and band saws; the latter undoubtedly
lends itself to a greater variety of uses, but it is also a far more dangerous
machine to have running in a room to which students are
to be given access. This latter consideration determined in the
present case the choice of a circular saw. It is quite dangerous
enough, and may be used only by, or under the supervision of, the
mechanic.</p>

<p>It has been stated on competent authority that a truly sound-proof
room cannot be built except under ground. This has not
been attempted, but the laboratory contains one room (no. 17)
which is virtually sound-proof. A double door separates it from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
the adjoining experimenter's room, and double doors also separate
this from the main hall. The wall between these two rooms
consists of two layers of plaster with special deadening material inserted
between. Two small tubes, ordinarily stuffed with felt, connect
these rooms. When the acoustical stimulus is a tuning-fork, it
is placed in a distant room, connected with one of the <em>b</em> circuits
of the sound-proof room, and then with a telephone receiver near
the subject's ear.</p>

<p>The photographic-room contains the ordinary sink, red lights,
shelves, etc. The indirect entrance is light-tight when the door
is not closed, so that the experimenter may pass in and out even
when developing is going on. This room, like all the others which
have no window (except the sound-proof room), has forced ventilation.</p>

<p>The class-room is designed for the experimental training-courses.
It has eight of the regular delivery-boards, ten tables, instrument-case,
blackboard, and sink.</p>

<p>The lecture-room for specialized courses in comparative and experimental
psychology seats eighty students. It is provided with
two Bausch and Lomb electric projection-lanterns, horizontal and
vertical microscope attachments, and attachment for the projection
of opaque objects. On the lecturer's platform, besides the blackboard,
projection-screen, and chart-racks (capable of holding twenty
charts), is a large demonstration-table provided with a delivery-board,
water, gas, sixteen chart-drawers, two other drawers, and
three cupboards.</p>

<p>As has been said before, the general psychology course of the
University is not given on the laboratory floor, but downstairs in the
large lecture-hall with about 400 seats. A number of large demonstration
instruments of the laboratory serve the special purpose
of this course; this hall too has its own stereopticons.</p>

<p>Our instrumentarium is, of course, in first line, the collection
of apparatus bought and constructed through the fourteen years of
work. Yet with the new expansion of the institute a considerable
number of psychological, physical, and physiological well-tested
instruments has been added. Especially in the departments of
kymographic, chronoscopic, and optical apparatus the equipment
presents a satisfactory completeness; its total value may be estimated
to represent about twelve thousand dollars. Yet the place of the
laboratory which we appreciate most highly is not the instrument-room
but the workshop, in which every new experimental idea can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
find at once its technical shape and form. Whether those experimental
ideas will be original and productive, whether their elaboration
will be helpful for the progress of our young science, in short,
whether the work in the new laboratory will fulfil the hopes with
which we entered it, may be better decided as soon as a few
further volumes of the Harvard Psychological Studies shall have
followed the present one, which is still from cover to cover a product
of Harvard's pre-Emerson-Hall period.</p>

<h2><a name="STEREOSCOPIC_VISION_AND_THE_DIFFERENCE" id="STEREOSCOPIC_VISION_AND_THE_DIFFERENCE"></a>STEREOSCOPIC VISION AND THE DIFFERENCE
OF RETINAL IMAGES</h2>

<p class="p1b">BY G. V. HAMILTON</p>


<p>The question which the Laboratory proposed to me for experimental
enquiry was one which demanded a definite reply of yes or
no. The positive answer seemed a necessary consequence of the
traditional psycho-physiological theories, while a certain practical
consideration seemed to suggest the negative solution. The question
which seems to have been overlooked so far was this: According
to the theory of stereoscopic vision two points of light which are
seen by each of the two eyes under the same angle appear to lie in
the same plane; as soon as the angle for the right eye is larger than
that for the left, that is, as soon as the two stimulated retinal points
in the right eye are more distant than the two retinal points stimulated
in the left eye, the right light-point seems to be farther away
than the left one. If we relate them to planes vertical on the
ideal binocular fixation-line, the right point lies in a more distant
plane. This principle, which, of course, controls all arrangements for
stereoscopic effect, is deduced from experiences in which the fixation-line
is vertical to the line that connects the nodal points of the two
eyes; the plane in which the equally distant points lie is then parallel
to the forehead. If, on the other hand, the eyes are turned to
the side, that is, if the ideal fixation-line forms an acute angle with
the line connecting the eyeballs, the two fixated light-points, which
lie in a plane perpendicular to the fixation-line, cannot be seen by
the two eyes under the same angle. Any object on my right side
is somewhat nearer to my right eye than to my left, and therefore
must throw a larger image on my right retina. The two light-points
of a plane vertical to the fixation-line give thus with the eyes turned
to the right two unequal pairs of retinal stimuli; and the difference
of the retinal stimulations is evidently just the same as if the
eyes were looking straight forward but the two lights were at different
distances. If difference of retinal images really produces the conscious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
experience of seeing the lights in differently distant planes,
vertical to the fixation-line, it follows that with the eyes turned to
the right, lights which objectively lie in the same plane must appear
subjectively to lie in different distances. The question arises whether
the facts correspond to this conclusion. If we look with eyes turned
sidewise towards a plane vertical to the direction of seeing, do the
points of that plane remain in it for consciousness or do we see them
in different planes? We see that practical considerations suggest
a "No" to this question, because it would mean that everything which
does not lie exactly in front of us must change its plastic form, and
this the more strongly the more we see it on our right or our left,
and this of course again the more strongly the nearer it is to
the eyes, inasmuch as the relative difference of the retinal images
must increase with the nearness of the object. If a short-sighted
person fixates an object a few centimetres from the eyes strongly
turned to the side, the distances in the retinal image of the one eye
may be almost the double of those in the other. Under normal
conditions the differences would be smaller, but yet everything would
be necessarily distorted in its three-dimension shape as soon as
it is seen in indirect vision or with sidewise fixation. On the other
hand, if the objects keep their three-dimensional relations in spite
of sidewise movements, it is evident that the accepted psycho-physiological
theory of stereoscopic vision is incomplete and must
be revised in a very essential way. The experiment had to decide.
Of course the question might be approached experimentally in
different ways. It would have been possible, for instance, to study
the stereoscopic synthesis of two separate flat pictures seen with the
eyeballs in different positions. But we preferred the simplest possible
way, seeking the threshold of distance for two parallel vertical
edges with eyes turned forward and to the side. We chose edges
instead of hanging threads for the purpose of avoiding the possible
influence of the apparent thickness of the threads on the judgment
of distance. Of course, distance is here never distance from the one
or the other eye, but from the centre of the line which connects the
two nodal points of the eyes; the two vertical planes whose edges
were to be compared stood always vertical on the ideal line of fixation
which starts from that central point between the two eyeballs.</p>

<p>The apparatus used in these experiments consists of three parts,
viz.:</p>

<p>(1) A plank 2.5 metres x 9.5 centimetres x 4 centimetres, set on
edge and screwed to a table at either end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>(2) A head-rest 45 centimetres high, 35 centimetres broad and 15
centimetres deep. Attached to the centre of the lower strip of the
frame is a concave trough for the chin. Another trough, shaped to
fit over the vertex and with a strip of wood fastened to the front of
it for the forehead, slides up or down within the frame. The attachment
for the forehead can be moved and fixed at various positions
antero-posteriorly. By means of these devices the head can be
securely fixed in any position desired without discomfort to the subject.</p>

<p>In order to have the eyes always in the same plane and at a known
distance from the apparatus at the other end of the plank, a hole
was made in either side of the frame with its centre at a level of the
eyes. Extending through the vertical diameter of each hole is a
fine wire. Fitted into the inner portion of each hole is a cardboard
tube 10 centimetres long: the inner end of each tube contains a
vertical wire so arranged that the four wires all fall into a plane at
right angles to the long direction of the plank. A mirror at the outer
exit of either hole enables the experimenter to align the tips of the
subject's corneÃ¦ with the wires.</p>

<p>Two parallel strips of wood are so attached to the "head-rest"
end of the plank&mdash;one below and the other above it&mdash;that they
can be rotated laterally upon the plank, with the bolt which secures
them to it for a centre of rotation. Opposite this centre, and attached
to the anterior surface of the upper parallel strip is a wire
needle 25 centimetres long. By means of a quadricircular piece
of cardboard attached to the plank at the end of the needle, the
extent of rotation to the right or left can be read off in degrees. (The
point midway between the two corneal tips when they are aligned
with the wires is in the same axis of rotation as the head-rest.)</p>

<p>A vertical iron rod 50 centimetres long extends upwards from
either end of the parallel strips, and upon these rods the frame of
the head-rest can be moved up or down by means of thumb-screws
upon which it rests.</p>

<p>(3) At the opposite end of the plank there is attached a flat board,
35 centimetres long and 30 centimetres wide. Attached to the edge of
the board which faces the head-rest is a piece of black cardboard 40
centimetres long by 35 centimetres broad. In the centre of the cardboard
is a rectangular aperture, 7 centimetres by 14 centimetres. On
the upper surface of the board are two slots, one at either side. Sliding
within each of these slots is a block of wood to which is attached
an upright sheet of black-painted tin, 15 centimetres wide and 20
centimetres high. The surfaces of these tins lie in planes parallel to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
the plane of the four wires in the head-rest, when the latter is at
right angles to the plank. When their surfaces are equidistant from
the wires, the inner vertical edges of the tins are separated from each
other by 3 centimetres. The sides of the slots, in which the blocks
with their tins slide, are fitted with millimetre scales, thus enabling
the experimenter to determine the distance of the edges from the
corneÃ¦. The point on the scale at which an edge was exactly 2 metres
from the vertical plane of the wires was chosen as the "zero"
point, and if this distance was decreased by moving an edge forward,
the latter was said to stand at "minus" one, two, or more
millimetres, as the case might be. Likewise, an edge was said to
stand at "plus" the number of millimetres' distance beyond the
zero point if it had been moved at a greater distance than 2 metres
from the wires. A piece of ground glass attached to the distal end
of apparatus enabled the experimenter to secure a uniform illumination,
the room being darkened and the light coming from a 32-candle-power
electric lamp set about a metre and a half behind and
on a slightly lower level than the glass.</p>

<p>It was found that by shading the lamp itself and admitting a dim
light to the room by means of drawing down only the ordinary thin
window-shades, the edges could be made to seem almost isolated in
space and to stand out in clear relief.</p>

<p>The subjects of the experiment were Messrs. Bell, Flexner, and
Tait. Each subject determined the equality-point and the threshold
for the normal primary position of the eyes, for the eyes in a lateral
position of 15&deg; and in a lateral position of 30&deg;, both to the left and
to the right.</p>

<p>Eyes at 0&deg; means the following: that the most anterior part of
the two corneÃ¦ lies in a plane parallel to and two metres' distance
from the plane in which the two parallel edges lie at 0. Eyes at 30&deg;
to the left means that a line drawn in front of the two corneÃ¦ intersects
such a line at an angle of 30&deg;, the left eye being at the distal
end of the line. In calculating the visual angles 7.4 mm. are added
in order to compensate for the distance from the extreme anterior
portion of the cornea to the nodal point of the eye.</p>

<p>The results for Mr. Tait are as follows:</p>

<p>The position of eyes 0&deg;. The right edge was moved, at first from
an evident + position to equality, then from equality to the - threshold,
then from an evident - position to equality, then from equality
to the + threshold. These four points were determined each fifteen
times and the average taken. Then exactly the same fifteen sets of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
four determinations with the left edge moved. The averages of these
120 experiments are these: When the left edge is moved from +
to =:-2.77, from = to -:-6.97, from - to =:+0.77, from =
to +5.93. When the right edge is moved from + to =: +2.83, from
= to -:-1.6, from - to =:+5.9, from = to +:+10.53. The first
equality-point appears thus when the left edge is moved at -0.76,
when the right edge is moved at +4.41, with a threshold of about
5 in either case. With the normal eye-position the edges must thus
not be exactly in the same plane to appear equally distant; at a
distance of 2000 mm. the left must be about 2 mm. nearer than the
right to appear in the same plane, vertical to the line of regard.</p>

<p>If the position of the eyes is 15&deg; to the left, we have the following
results: When the left edge is moved from + to =:-4.17, from
= to -:-8.5, from - to =:-1.33, from = to +:+1; when the
right edge is moved from + to =:+4.17, from = to -:+1.17,
from - to =:+4.5, from = to +:+8.67.</p>

<p>If the position of the eyes is 30&deg; to the left, we find when the
left edge is moved from + to =:-2.67, from = to -:-6.67, from -
to =:+0.5, from = to +:+3.33. When the right edge is moved
from + to =:+2.33, from = to -:-0.02, from - to =:+9., from
= to +:+12.33.</p>

<p>If we take again the general averages, we have for the eye-position
of 15&deg; to the left an equality-point of -3.25 if the left edge is
moved and judged and +4.63 if the right edge is moved and judged.
That is, if the right edge stands at 2000 mm. the left edge must be
moved to 1996.75, and if the left stands at 2000, the right must be
moved to 2004.63. For the eye-position of 30&deg; to the left, the
equality-point lies at -1.49 if the left edge is moved and judged, and
at +5.91 if the right edge is the variable. The threshold lies in all
three cases, for eyes at 0&deg;, at 15&deg;, and at 30&deg;, at about Â±5 mm.; the
position of the eyes has thus no influence on the threshold for the
perception of distance in the direction of regard.</p>

<p>But the point essential for our investigation is of course not the
threshold but the equality-point. To take the extremes of the eye-positions
0&deg; and 30&deg; we find the equality when the left edge is judged,
at -0.76 for 0&deg; and -1.49 for 30&deg;, and when the right edge is moved,
at +4.41 at 0&deg; and +5.91 at 30&deg;; the middle is thus +1.82 for 0&deg;
and +2.21 for 30&deg;, that is a difference of less than 0.4 mm.</p>

<p>To understand this figure we must enter into the calculation of
the angles. We have an eye-distance of 60 mm., a distance of the
edges from the cornea 2000 mm., from the nodal points 2007.4 mm.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
the distance of each edge from the median line 15 mm., the distance
of the two edges from each other thus 30 mm. as long as they
are in the same plane. We have to determine the angle under which
each eye sees the distance of the two edges. A simple trigonometric
calculation gives the following figures: If both eyes are in normal
position, at 0&deg;, and both edges are in the same plane, 2000 mm. from
the corneÃ¦, the angle for each eye is 51' 22". If the left edge is now
moved to +5, the left eye sees the distance of the edges at an angle of
51' 25", the right eye under 51' 10", the difference is thus 15"; if the
left edge is at +10 mm., the left eye's angle is 51' 29", the right eye's
angle 50' 59", the difference 30". If the left edge is moved to -5 mm.,
the left eye's angle is 51' 18", the right eye's angle 51' 33", the difference
15"; if the left edge is moved to -10 mm., the left eye's angle
is 51' 14", the right eye's angle 51' 45", the difference 31". Now we saw
that with normal eye-position when the left edge was moved the threshold
was +5.93 and -6.97; a difference of 15" to 20" between the
visual angles of the two eyes was thus amply sufficient to give a
distinct experience of different distance. When the left eye's angle
was about 15" smaller than the angle of the right eye, the difference
of the retinal images gave a sure impression of the greater nearness
of the left edge.</p>

<p>If we now bring the eyes into the position of 30&deg;, the angles are of
course different when both edges are in the same plane vertical to the
direction of regard. If the two edges are in the same plane, the left
eye's angle is 50' 59" and the right eye's angle 51' 45", the difference
thus 46". If we move the left edge to +5, the left angle becomes 51' 1",
the right angle 51' 34", the difference 33". If we move the left to +10,
the left angle becomes 51' 4", the right 51' 24"; the difference is thus
still 20", and we must move the left edge to +17 mm. to get an equal
angle for the left and the right eye. If we move the left to -5, the
difference becomes of course larger, the left eye sees under 50' 56",
the right eye 51' 55", the difference 59"; and at -10, the left eye
has the angle 50' 53", the right eye 52' 6", difference 1' 13". It is hardly
necessary to state here the angles for the changes of the right edge
or for an eye-position of 15&deg;, inasmuch as the maximum differences
bring out our case most clearly. With an eye-position of 15&deg;, the
edges at the same plane give angles of 51' 10" and 51'34", that is, a
difference of 24"; if the left edge is moved to -5 mm. the difference
becomes 38"; if it is moved to -10 mm. the difference is 54"; if the
left edge is moved to +5 the difference decreases to 10" and at +10 mm.
to 6".</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>We have thus the following fundamental result: If the eyes
are in normal primary position, a movement of the left edge to Â±6 mm.
is constantly apperceived at threshold of distance and this corresponds
to retinal images whose visual angles differ by about 17".
A difference of 17" in the visual angles of the two eyes produces thus
under the conditions of this experiment for this subject a strong
stereoscopic effect when the eyes are in primary position. If the eyes
are in the position of the head 30&deg; to the left, the left eye thus much
further from the edges than the right eye, the visual angle of the left
image thus much smaller than that of the right image, we find the
same equality-point with the same threshold. We saw that in this
position the two visual angles would be equal if the left edge were
moved to +17 mm.; instead of at +17, the equality-point&mdash;when
the left edge is judged&mdash;lies at -1.49, that is, at a point at which the
visual angle of the left eye is more than 46" smaller than the angle of
the right eye. While in normal position a difference of the two retinal
images of 17" constitutes a distinct threshold value; at a lateral position
of the eyes of 30&deg; the great difference of 46" becomes necessary
to give the impression of equal plane, while a decrease of that difference
to 30" gives a distinct feeling of greater distance. Equal retinal
images produce for the lateral eyes thus the same effect which for
the normal position very different images produce; and to get for the
lateral eyes the effect which equal images produce for the normal
position, the angles of the images must differ by 46".</p>

<p>The results for the second subject, Mr. Flexner, are practically the
same. With the position of the eyes at 0&deg;, when the left edge is judged
and moved, we find the following averages: from + to =: +0.03, from
= to -:-3.8, from - to =:-0.7, from = to +:+3.93; when
the right edge is moved from + to =:-0.08, from = to -:-4.29,
from - to =:+1.21, from = to +:+4.08. It is evident that the difference
between right and left which existed for Mr. Tait does not
enter into Mr. Flexner's results. The equality-point as average of
120 experiments lies for normal eye-position practically at zero, and
the threshold is Â±4 mm.; his sensibility for differences of retinal
images is thus still finer than for Mr. Tait, as we saw that the threshold
of Â±4 mm. means a difference of visual angles of less than 15".
If Mr. Flexner's head is turned 15&deg; to the left, his left eye thus considerably
farther away from the edges than the right eye, the results
are these: If the left edge is moved and judged, we find from + to =:-0.02,
from = to -:-3.17, from - to =:0, from = to +:+4.67;
if the right edge is moved from + to =:-0.01, from = to -:-2.5,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
from - to =:-0.8, from = to +:+3.33. Experiments with lateral
movement of 30&deg; were not carried through, as the subject, accustomed
to eye-glasses, became less accurate in the judgments; but the experiments
with the position of 0&deg; and of 15&deg; are unequivocal. They
show that the equality-point and the thresholds are exactly the same
for 15Â´ as for 0&deg;. For the lateral position of 15&deg; again the average
equality-point is exactly at 0&deg; and the threshold at less than Â±4 mm.
We saw that for a lateral movement of 15&deg; the difference of the angles
at the equality-point is 24". We find thus for Mr. Flexner that with
primary eye-position a difference of angles of less than 15" gives a
distinct stereoscopic effect, while with a lateral position of the eyes
a plane effect demands a difference of 24" for the two visual angles.</p>

<p>Experiments with Dr. Bell finally showed a rather strong fluctuation
of judgments and the determination of the equality-point for
normal eye-position has not only too large a middle variation to be
a reliable basis, but is influenced by a constant tendency to underestimate
the distance of the edge moved. Yet the general result is the
same as with the other two subjects, that is, the equality-point is
with him, too, practically the same for the eyes in normal and in
lateral position.</p>

<p>The general conclusion from the results of all three subjects is thus
evidently that the traditional physiological theory is untenable, the
stereoscopic effect cannot be simply a function of the difference of the
two retinal images. The same pair of unequal retinal images which
gives a most striking stereoscopic effect for eyes in primary position,
has no stereoscopic effect for eyes in lateral position and <em>vice versa</em>.
The stereoscopic interpretation is thus the function of both the difference
of the retinal images and the position of the eyeballs. Of course
the two retinal images are in any case never felt as two pictures if
they are not different enough to produce a double image. With the
primary position of the eyes as long as the two different retinal views
are sufficiently similar to allow a synthesis in a three-dimensional
impression of our object, we perceive every point of the object not
as double image but as one point of a given distance. The distance
feeling of the normal stereoscopic vision demands thus itself more than
the reference to the different retinal images, and the only factor
which can explain the phenomena is the response of the eye-muscles
which react on the double images by increase or decrease of convergence.
The distance of a point in a stereoscopic image is determined
by the impulse necessary for that particular act of convergence
of the eyeballs by which the two retinal images on non-cor-responding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
points would be changed into images on corresponding
points. The different retinal images are thus ever for the normal
eye-position merely the stimuli for the production of that process
which really determines the experience of distance, that is, the motor
impulse to a change in convergence.</p>

<p>If thus the stereoscopic vision under normal conditions is ultimately
dependent upon the central motor impulses, it is not surprising that
a change in the psycho-physical conditions of movement produces a
change in the resulting impulses. Such a change in the conditions is
given indeed whenever the eyes are in a lateral position. Just as the
same stimulus produces a different response when the arm or leg is in
a flexed or an extended position, so the retinal double images stimulate
different responses according to the particular position of the eyeballs.
That pair of unequal retinal images that in primary eye-position
produce in going from one end of the object to the other a strong
increase of convergence and thus a feeling of greater nearness, may
produce with the lateral eye-position no increase of convergence and
thus a feeling of equal distance or even a decrease of convergence and
thus a feeling of removal. The psycho-physical system upon which
our three-dimensional visual perception depends is then much more
complex than the usual theory teaches; it is not the retinal image of the
double eye, but this image together with the whole distribution of
contractions in the eye-muscles, which determines the stereoscopic
vision: the same retinal images may give very different plastic perceptions
for different positions of the eyeballs.</p>

<p>The experiments point thus to the same complex connection
which Professor MÃ¼nsterberg emphasized in his studies of the "Perception
of distance."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> I may quote the closing part of his article to
bring out the intimate connection of the two problems. He reports
his observations on the so-called verant and insists that the monocular
verant almost as little as the ordinary binocular stereoscope can give
the impression of normal distance of nature. Professor MÃ¼nsterberg
writes: "Whoever is able to separate seeing in three dimensions from
seeing in natural distance cannot doubt that in both cases alike
we reach the first end, the plastic interpretation, but are just as far
removed from the other, the feeling of natural distance, as in the
ordinary vision of pictures. The new instrument is thus in no way a
real 'verant.'</p>

<p>"The question arises, Why is that so? If I bring my landscape picture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
on a transparent glass plate into such a distance from my one
eye that every point of this transparent photograph covers for my resting
eye exactly the corresponding point of the real landscape and
yet accommodation is excluded, as, for instance, in the case of the
short-sighted eye, or in the case of the normal eye with the verant
lenses, then we have exactly the retinal images of the real view of
nature and the same repose of the lens. Why are we, nevertheless,
absolutely unable to substitute the near object for the far one? This
problem exists in spite of all the theoretical assurances that the one
ought to appear exactly like the other, and I think that it is not impossible
to furnish an answer to it.</p>

<p>"If I am not mistaken, there is one point of difference between seeing
the mere picture and seeing the far landscape, which has been
neglected in the usual discussions. Every one knows, of course, that
we see the picture and the landscape normally with the help of eye-movements.
The eye moves from point to point; but psychologists
have neglected the consideration that the relation between eye-movement
and retinal image must be quite a different one for the landscape
and for its photograph. Let us consider the simplest possible
case, the case of the myopic eye without any lenses whatever, and
without any need of accommodation for a picture as near to the eye
as 10 cm.   If I take a small landscape picture made with a camera
whose distance from lens to plate is 10 cm., I have a splendid plastic
view if I see it at a distance of about 10 cm. from my eye. I have before
me just such a picture in which two mountain peaks are, in the
photograph, 1 cm. distant from each other. If I now have my little
picture at the distance of 10 cm. from the eye, these two mountain
tops correspond in their distance of 1 cm. exactly to the retinal image
which the two real mountains, which are ten miles away and one
mile distant from each other, produce in my retina. The retinal
image of the two mountain peaks in the photograph is thus for my
resting eye indeed identical with that of real nature. Does that mean
that I have to make the same eye-movement to go from the left to
the right mountain in the landscape as in the picture? Of course,
that would be so, the movement would be just as identical as
the retinal images if the nodal point of the light-rays were identical
with the rotation-point of the eyeball. But everybody knows that
this is not at all the case. The light-rays cross in the lens. The angle
of vision, and thus the size of the retinal image, are thus dependent
upon the distance of the lens from the retina. But the movement of
the eye is related to a rotation-point which lies about 13 mm. behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
the cornea, roughly speaking 1 cm. behind the nodal point of the
rays. This additional centimetre plays, of course, no rÃ´le whatever,
if I look at my mountains in the real landscape; following with my
eyeball from the fixation-point of the left mountain to the fixation-point
of the right mountain, I make a movement whose angle can
be declared identical with the angle under which I saw the two mountains
with the resting eye in the first position. This angle of vision
was determined by the distance of the nodal point, which was in
our case ten miles, while the angle of eye-movement was determined
by the distance of the rotation-point, which would be ten miles plus
one centimetre, and there is of course no possible difference for practical
discrimination between these two distances.</p>

<p>"But the situation is completely changed if I turn to my little picture
10 cm. distant from my eye. The angle under which I see my
two peaks is, of course, again the same under which I saw them in
the real landscape. It is determined by the distance of the picture
from the nodal point, which is in this case 10 cm. But the angle of
the eye-movement necessary to fixate first the left and then the right
peak is now a much smaller one because it is again determined by
the distance from the rotation-point, and that is in this case 10 cm.
plus 1 cm. With this short distance of the picture from the eye this
one additional centimetre is not at all the negligible quantity which
it was in addition to ten miles in the landscape. For the two real
mountains the angle of the eye-movement had a tangent of one tenth;
for the photograph mountains, in spite of their equal size of retinal
image, the angle of necessary movement would of course have a
tangent of one eleventh. Roughly speaking, we could say that the
photograph, in order to produce the same eye-movement which the
mountains in the landscape excited, would need a pictorial distance
between the two photograph mountains of 11 mm. instead of 10 mm.
Of course if the distance in the picture were made 11 mm. instead
of 10, it would not cover any more the mountains of the landscape.
The retinal image would thus be relatively too large and would not
give us any longer the true landscape. On the other hand, if we
tried to correct it by bringing the picture one centimetre nearer to
the eye, then of course every retinal image would be enlarged by
that necessary tenth, and yet there would be no help for the situation,
as now again the eye-movement demanded by the retinal image
would be relatively increased too.</p>

<p>"We can put it in this way: <em>my real landscape demands a relation
between retinal image and movement which my picture cannot produce</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
<em>under any circumstances whatever</em>. That which would be needed
to imitate the relations would be realized only if I had my retinal
images from the picture at a distance of 10 cm., and at the same
time the movements belonging to the same picture seen at a distance
of 9 cm. That is of course unrealizable. We cannot see a
picture without having our movements constantly controlled by
the size of the real retinal images, as it is necessary that the distance
seen in indirect vision is the distance covered by the fixation-point
during the eye-movement. That demands, as we have seen, a different
relation between retinal image and eye-movement for near
and far, and no verant and no stereoscope can eliminate this factor.
If a 10-mm. object in the photograph demands an 11-mm. movement
to give the impression of real natural distance, then we have
a condition which cannot be fulfilled.</p>

<p>"If we remember how extremely delicate is our normal sensitiveness
for retinal distances and how the newer studies in stereoscopic
vision have demonstrated an unsuspected delicacy of adjustment
between retinal images and motor responses, it is evident that this
so far always neglected relation must be an extremely important
one. If we have one adjustment of central reaction in which a certain
eye-movement corresponds to retinal images of one size, and another
adjustment in which the same movements correspond to retinal
images which are ten per cent larger, we can really not expect our
judgment of distance to neglect the difference between these two
systems of relations. Of course they represent two extreme cases.
Every distance beyond 10 cm. demands its special adjustment up
to the point where the distance becomes too large to be influenced
by the distance from the nodal point to the rotation-point. We must
thus presuppose a sliding scale of ever new adjustments for the different
distances at which we see any object, and we have, in this
relation, probably not the least important factor in the judgment of
the third dimension for relatively near objects, and probably even
more important than the irradiation circles which control the accommodation,
as these circles must be the same for objects which lie before
and behind the fixation-point. Of course the whole system of
our localizing reactions becomes through these considerations more
complex by far than the schematizations of the text-books propose.
But physiological optics has shown at every point in its development
that mere simplification has not always meant a deeper insight
into the real relations."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>It is evident that our studies in stereoscopic vision with lateral
eye-position involve exactly the same principle and reaffirm completely
Professor MÃ¼nsterberg's theoretical views. In both cases, in
the monocular of the verant as in the binocular of our experiments,
the same retinal image has different psycho-physiological space-value
on account of the different motor situation.</p>

<h2>EYE-MOVEMENTS DURING DIZZINESS</h2>

<p class="p1b">BY E. B. HOLT</p>


<p>It is a familiar fact that when the head is passively turned about
its vertical axis, the eyes do not move with the head but lag behind,
keeping their fixation on that object toward which they were directed
before the head moved. The eyes move in their sockets in a direction
opposite to that in which the head has moved. Now it has been
proved beyond a doubt by the experiments of Mach,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Crum Brown,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
and Breuer,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> that these lagging movements of the eyes are reflex
and are governed by the semi-circular canals, which are stimulated
directly by the motion of the head. Similar reflex eye-movements are
found when the head is turned about some other than its vertical
axis, the direction of such movements being always in confirmation
of the theory. All these movements, together with the theory, are
well described in the summaries of Peters<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and Nagel.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The present
paper deals solely with the eye-movements that occur after rotation
of the head about its vertical axis.</p>

<p>The mechanism of these lagging, reflex movements is not, then,
identical with that which enables us, when the head is at rest, to fix
on and follow a luminous moving object,&mdash;the "pursuit movements"
of Dodge.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> It is, however, identical with that of Dodge's "fourth
type"<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and that of the compensatory eye-movements described by
Brown,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Nagel,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and Delage,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and recently studied by Angier.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
This <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>function of the semi-circular canals was first suggested by
Goltz in 1870. Now if the rotary movement of the head is prolonged,
the eyes lag for a while on their first fixation-point, and then dart
suddenly forward to a new fixation-point on which they rest for a
while as before, until they dart forward again. Therefore if the head
continues to rotate, the eyes fall into a regular and well-marked
nystagmus. In this the lagging movements, or those opposite to the
direction of the head, are called "compensatory," and are relatively
slow and long. Their rate coincides closely if not exactly with that
of the head-movement. But the movements forward, in the direction of
the head-movement, are short and swift. Such are the facts during the
rotation of the head.</p>

<p>But if this rotation has been somewhat prolonged, the ocular
nystagmus continues after the head and body are brought to rest.
But now its phases are reversed, and the slower eye-movements are
in that direction in which the head has moved; while the swifter are
in what before was the lagging direction. These observations are in
accord with the semicircular canal theory, and are well established
by various investigators.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>This paper presents the results of a photographic study of the
reflex eye-movements following after rotation of the head (and body)
about the vertical axis.</p>

<p>The subject whose eyes were to be photographed sat in a chair
placed on a rotating platform, in such a position that the vertical
axis of rotation passed through, or just posterior to the nose. Rays
from an arc-lamp of 6 amperes, placed about 60 cm. from the subject's
face, were so converged by a lens that when the subject came
to rest, after the rotation, his two eyes were brightly illuminated. An
adiathermal screen consisting of a dilute solution of copper ammonium
sulphate kept the heat from being painfully intense on the eyes.
The light fell slightly from one side on the subject's face, when he was
brought to rest; and directly in front of him, at a distance of about
40 cm., was a camera of which the lens was on a level with his eyes.
The ordinary ground-glass screen at the back of this camera was
replaced by a light-proof box, in the front of which, and in the plane
which should have been that of the ground glass, was a slit 55 mm.
broad and 5 mm. high. Inside the box was a Ludwig kymograph of
which the drum rotated on a horizontal axis: the circumference
of the drum lay tangentially to the front of the box, and the line of
tangency passed horizontally through the long axis of the slit. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
each photograph a photographic film of sensitometer 40 was fixed
to the drum, as paper is ordinarily fastened, and in moving, the drum
carried this film upwards past the slit. It follows from this arrangement
that 5 mm. along the length of this film were always exposed
at once. The camera was so focused that the images of both eyes
were sent through the slit, and fell on the film.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img  src="images/i_059.jpg" alt="Electric currents" />
<div class="caption"><p class="caption">Figs. 1 and 2</p></div>
</div>

<p>The subject's head was rigidly held by a rest: this rest was adjusted,
and the camera focused, before the rotation. The adjustment
of the head was greatly facilitated by fastening a fine black
thread to pegs that projected forward from the head-rest, on either
side; the thread was stretched horizontally, and at such a height that
its image in the camera coincided with the middle of the long (horizontal)
axis of the open slit. If then the subject, on seating himself
in the chair, had his head so adjusted that each eye was directly behind
the thread, each eye would certainly be imaged on the sensitive film.
Neither the shadow of this thread on the subject's face, nor its image
on the film, interfered in the least with the exposure that was made
after rotation. This thread was further found very useful by the
subject himself, who, after the rotation and just before the exposure
was made, could make sure by sighting on the thread that
his eyes had not slightly changed position during the rather protracted
rotation. The subject was ordinarily turned twenty-five times
at about the rate of one turn in two seconds. The kymograph was
set in motion and the exposure commenced as soon as the whirling
chair was brought to a dead stop. This stopping always took two or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
three seconds, at the very time when the nystagmus was most pronounced,
so that the photographs do not show the maximum eye-movements.
The exposure lasted through one rotation of the drum,
nine seconds.</p>

<p>In the strongest negatives the movements of the eyes can be fairly
well made out from the undulatory curve generated on the film by
the dark image of the iris as it oscillated from side to side. But this
is true only of the best negatives, and almost never of these if the eyes
photographed had the iris blue. In order to obtain better definition
in the photographs of the eye-movements, small flecks of Chinese
white were tried, as invented and described by Judd.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> A small square
of white was laid with a brush on each cornea, on the side toward the
lamp, so that its image on the film should be as bright as possible.
The flecks were found to adhere to the eyeball even more perfectly
than Judd himself has claimed; and they produced so little discomfort
that the subject ordinarily forgot their presence on the eyes.
Nevertheless their image as produced on the negatives, although
much better than that of the iris, was generally not clearly readable,
owing to the brief exposure and the illumination by electric light.
This light seems not to be well reflected by the Chinese white: but in
all cases where daylight can be employed the use of these flecks must
be eminently satisfactory.</p>

<p>Thus it was found necessary to fall back on the image of the arc
as reflected from the cornea. This corneal image invariably traced
a clear, strong curve on the negative, and would have been appropriated
at the outset, were it not that its movements are not, as is
well known, a true register of the <em>amplitude</em> of the corresponding
eye-movements; a fact that was shown clearly from a comparison
in these negatives of the curves produced respectively by the flecks
of Chinese white and by the corneal image. The former showed a
much greater amplitude of movement. But the corneal reflection is
a perfect register of the <em>time</em> and <em>direction</em> of the eye-movements; and
in the following tables these features alone are studied. This reflection
traced on the film a perfectly readable curve, although in some
of the films, owing to a shifting of the carbons in the lamp taking
place during the rotation, one of the eyes would be badly illuminated
and a good record would be obtained from the other eye alone.</p>

<p>The arc ran on an alternating circuit of 60 phases per second,
and owing to these interruptions of the illumination the curve of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
corneal image showed on the negative as a dotted line in which the
distance between any two dots represented one sixtieth of a second.
Since the constancy of this alternation in the current has been measured
in the Jefferson Physical Laboratory (of Harvard), and found
to vary within a few tenths of one per cent only, the spacing of the
dots on the negatives formed the most convenient possible means for
determining the durations of the nystagmiform movements. These
dots are shown in Figs. 3, 4, and 5 (Plates I and II).</p>

<p class="caption">(By an error Fig. 4 is shown reversed; the lettering is correct.)</p>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 3 shows a portion of one of the films. The two curves are to
be read from below upwards; but at the bottom is a photograph
of the slit (showing a part of the subject's face) taken when the
drum had made a little over one revolution and had come back to rest.
Hence below the image of the slit, the curve of corneal reflection is
doubled. "Right" and "Left" refer to the subject's right and left
sides, so that the reader looks into the subject's face from in front.
In the picture of the slit, the place on the cornea of the corneal reflection
is shown; and also a minor reflection, which as may be seen
traced no curve, from some other source of light. The fine line that
crosses the slit horizontally is the image of the thread, above mentioned,
which was used in adjusting the head. The time-dots are
seen to be perfectly distinct, so that they could be accurately read
with the help of a jeweller's eyeglass. Fig. 4 shows another part
of the same negative, a portion subsequent to the single eye-curves of
Fig. 3, that is, a continuation vertically upwards of Fig. 3. The rotation
had been from the subject's left to his right, a direction that
will be termed "clockwise" throughout this paper, and it can be seen
that the quick eye-movements are toward the subject's <em>left</em>, while
the slow are towards his right: had the photograph been taken
<em>during</em> the rotation, the directions of the quick and slow movements
would have been reversed. Two points may be observed in this
figure which the tables will also bring out,&mdash;that the two eyes
move together, and that as the nystagmus subsides the quick eye-movements
become less frequent but endure no longer, or in other
words, the slow movements alone increase in duration. The corneal
reflection does not accurately show the amplitude of the movements;
but direct inspection of a subject's eyes, as the nystagmus dies away,
shows that generally (but perhaps not always) the amplitudes of
both quick and slow movements decrease together. When this is
the case, it follows that at the end of the nystagmus the <em>rate</em> of the
slow movements decreases very much faster than that of the rapid
movements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>Readable negatives were obtained from four, out of six subjects.
Of such negatives there are fourteen, ten of which are of eye-movements
after rotation clockwise, and four after rotation anti-clockwise.
This distribution is accidental, for the rotations in each direction
were about equal in number. With the exceptions to be noted
later all the negatives exhibit the same features, so that of the fourteen
only four examples are given in full in the tables; while for the others
merely the averages of the duration of quick and slow eye-movements
respectively are given.</p>

<p>Table I gives these averages for all the fourteen negatives. In
four of these (H 2, H 3, Tu 1, Tu 2) simultaneous curves for both
eyes were obtained. In every curve the slow eye-movements were
in the same direction as the previous rotation; the rapid in the
opposite direction. The very few single movements that are exceptions
to this are noted under Table II. Had the photographs been
taken during (instead of after) the rotation, the directions of rapid
and slow movements would undoubtedly have been reversed. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
to be noted that when both eyes were recorded, their movements
were generally identical, within the accuracy of measurement (one
sixtieth of a second). There are a few exceptions to this. The averages
of all slow and all rapid movements merely show that in general,
and for that part of the nystagmus that was photographed, the
slow eye-movements lasted six times as long as the rapid ones. This
ratio varies considerably from one case to another, and at best throws
little light on the whole nystagmiform series, since during the very
first instants after the rotation the ratio of quick to slow movements
would be less than one sixth, and at the very end of the series would
be considerably more; this because toward the end the slow movements
become much slower, while the rapid seem to change very
little. The variations from case to case arise, at least partly, because
in some cases the picture was taken more promptly, after the
rotation stopped, than in others.</p>

<p>Table II gives in detail the data yielded by four of the most instructive
films. C 3 is the longest record that was obtained; Tu 4 is
among the shortest, though it is not the very shortest. H 2 and H 3
show how nearly alike are the simultaneous movements of the two
eyes: .07 sec. is the greatest difference recorded on any film between
simultaneous movements. All four records show how much less
the duration of the slow movements is at the beginning of the record
than at the end, and how little the fast movements vary in this respect.</p>

<p>H 2 is given because it is not typical; and about one half of the
film itself is reproduced in Fig. 5 (Plate II). It will be seen that at four
points there intervened between slow movements (toward the right)
a rapid one that was also toward the right. This is the only record
in which such a thing happened: and its explanation is problematical.
With the subjects C and H, and only very rarely with these,
a rapid movement sometimes took the place of a slow one, that is,
occurred in the same direction as the slow movements (<em>e. g.</em>, Table II,
C 3). And a trifle more often, yet very seldom, a rapid movement
was relatively slow (<em>e. g.</em>, <em>ibid.</em>). With every subject there are a few
cases in which the eyes stood still for a small part of a second (<em>e. g.</em>,
<em>ibid.</em>), and these moments of rest seem to come after a rapid or a
slow movement indifferently.</p>

<p>McAllister<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and others have shown that the eyes are seldom at
rest even when voluntary fixation is attempted, and these anomalies
in the nystagmiform series may well be the result of such random
factors, which instead of being always inhibited by the afferent
impulses from the semicircular canals, which govern the nystagmus,
operate along with these latter, and sometimes even inhibit them.
With the exception of these anomalies, the movements recorded in
the photographs confirm the observations of Purkinje, Mach, Breuer,
Delage, and other investigators.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the sensations of vertigo and of nausea seem not
to be essentially connected with the nystagmus. Several subjects
were so disagreeably affected by a preliminary rotation that it seemed
best not to continue the experiment with them. With those, however,
whose eyes were photographed, while they experienced a mild
degree of vertigo and nausea during and after the first few rotations,
these sensations soon wore off with further practice, while so
far as could be observed their eye-movements were as ample and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
rapid as at first. The introspection of these subjects was that after
the rotation the body seemed at rest and the stomach quite settled,
while the visual field alone whirled rapidly in the direction opposite
to that of the previous rotation.</p>

<h2><a name="VISION_DURING_DIZZINESS" id="VISION_DURING_DIZZINESS"></a>VISION DURING DIZZINESS</h2>

<p class="p1b">BY E. B. HOLT</p>


<p>During and after a prolonged rotation of the head, the visual
field seems to spin around before one's eyes,&mdash;a phenomenon that
is ordinarily called the "dizziness of Purkinje." Delage describes it
as follows:<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> "In the experiment of Purkinje, while we are rotating
in a positive sense, space seems possessed of a motion in the opposite
direction.... This phenomenon is explained <em>by the direction of
the nystagmus</em>."</p>

<p>"In the nystagmus," he continues, "the eyeballs execute two
well-differentiated motions: one, a compensatory, <em>relatively</em> slow
motion, during which images pass across the retina so as to give the
appearance of a movement of space in the opposite direction; two,
a swift motion opposite to the slow one, and so rapid that the images
passing across the retina leave no sensation of their movement."</p>

<p>Now, in a previous paper<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> I have shown that there is a central
anÃ¦sthesia, or central inhibition of visual sensations, during about
the latter two thirds of the time occupied by every voluntary eye-jump;
and in view of this I was led to enquire whether in fact, as
Delage so confidently asserts, it is the <em>speed</em> of these more rapid
movements, or some other factor, that causes them to leave no visual
sensations. There can be no doubt that they do leave none, since,
aside from the statement of Delage, in dizziness the visual field
whirls always in only one direction; whereas it should otherwise
appear to swing now to one side, now to the other, as the eyes
move back and forth across the objects. I have found but one
other mention of this point in the literature. In his Analyse,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Mach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
says, parenthetically, "(the jerky eye-movement leaves no optical
impression)"; but he does not suggest that this is because of its
greater speed.</p>

<p>In order to test this point, a 2 c. p. incandescent lamp was so arranged
that it could be moved vertically in front of, and about four
metres distant from, a rotating chair. Since after a rotation the eyes
are oscillating from side to side, if the lamp is moved up and down
an obliquely inclined after-image streak must be generated on the
retina; and clearly there are four possible positions in which this
may lie, as shown in Fig. 1.</p>

<p>The results were absolutely uniform (the author alone as subject);
the after-image streak always lay on that side of the moving
light <em>toward</em> which the <em>slow</em> eye-movements were directed, that
is, the lamp appeared to drift obliquely up or down and in a lateral
direction <em>opposite</em> to that of the slow eye-movements. Apart from
its vertical displacement, then, the lamp behaved like the less intensely
illumined parts of the visual field, seeming to be totally
invisible during the swifter eye-movements. Now since the experiment
was done in a partially darkened room and the eyes were
partly adapted to darkness, the lamp should have been intense
enough adequately to stimulate the retina even during the more
rapid movements, and might be expected to leave an after-image
streak on that side toward which these rapid movements were directed,
and differing only from the streaks seen during the slow
eye-movements in being inclined at a less angle from the horizontal.
Yet no such streaks were visible.</p>

<p>These observations were made at about the same number of
seconds after the rotation stopped, as the photographs were taken
that are recorded in the preceding paper of this volume. The rapid
movements were therefore about one sixth as long in duration as
the slower ones. Since the respective amplitudes of rapid and slow
must average very nearly the same, the rapid movements must have
been about six times as swift as the slow movements. It needs therefore
to be shown beyond a doubt that the 2 c. p. lamp <em>was</em> bright
enough, in view of the briefness of stimulation of any one retinal
element during the rapid eye-movement, to be above the threshold
of perception. For this reason the experiment was not continued
with other subjects.</p>

<p>The certainly adequate degree of illumination was realized during
the photography of the eyes described in the preceding paper.
Here during the post-rotary dizziness an arc lamp (of 6 amp.) was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
front of the face and but a little to one side of the primary line of
regard; it was 60 cm. distant from the eyes and on a level with
them; a lens condensed the rays on the two eyes, and the light
was diminished only just enough as not to be painful, by a dilute
screen of copper ammonium sulphate about 3 cm. thick. Of course
such an illumination must adequately stimulate each retinal element
even during the most rapid eye-movements. Nevertheless with the
four subjects that were photographed the arc lamp, like the rest of
the visual field, seemed always to swim in one direction, and that
opposite to the slower eye-movements. In one case where the eyes
were photographed without the adiathermal screen, and the light
was rather painfully intense, the lamp was still seen to drift in one
and the same direction. There was never any trace of its moving
to and fro, as there should have been had it been visible during both
phases of the nystagmiform movements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>This absence of visual sensation during the more rapid eye-movements
might conceivably depend on either peripheral or central
inhibitory factors. But the anatomy and physiology of the eye offer
no point of support for the supposition that during such movements
the irritability of the rods and cones is momentarily reduced,
or that the retinal layers posterior to the rods and cones suffer an
interruption of function during a movement of the eyeball in its
socket. Indeed, during some such movements, the "pursuit" movements
(Dodge's second type), vision is unimpaired.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> In view of
these facts, and of the many known cases of the mutual inhibition
of sensations where undoubtedly the process is a central one, it is
by far most probable that this visual inhibition is also a central process;
as was certainly the visual inhibition during voluntary eye-jumps,
previously reported by me.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>The conclusion above reported that the visual inhibition during
the more rapid phase of the nystagmus in no wise depends on an
inadequate stimulation of the retina, due to the greater speed of
the rapid movements, and that the inhibitory process is purely central,
is further supported by the following phenomenon. If before
the rotation has commenced, the eyes are so strongly stimulated
that a lasting after-image is obtained, this after-image will, during
the rotation, always be seen to swim in the direction opposite to
the rotation, that is, <em>with</em> the <em>slow</em> eye-movements; but when the
rate of rotation begins to decrease, and as Mach, Breuer, and Delage
have shown, the slow eye-movements reverse their direction,
the after-image also reverses its direction, and now swims in the
direction of rotation, that is, <em>still with</em> the <em>slow</em> eye-movements. If
the after-image persists long enough, it may still be observed, after
the rotation has ceased, swimming in the same direction as the
surviving slow eye-movements. If, for instance, the slow movements
are from left to right, the after-image (best seen with the eyes
closed) swims from the left to the right hand side of the field and
disappears, reappears at the left and swims again toward the right,
and continues to do this until the nystagmus entirely ceases.</p>

<p>This experiment was repeated several times, with four subjects,
and with both clockwise and anti-clockwise rotations, and the results
were uniformly as described above. In order to see whether
this motion of the after-image really depended on the slower nystagmiform<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
movements, the following variation was tried. It will be
recalled that if the head is rotated not about a vertical (longitudinal)
axis, but about a transverse axis, as, say, one passing through
the ears, a nystagmus is produced in which during the rotation the
slower eye-movements are opposite to the direction of rotation,
while when the rotation is checked or stopped, the nystagmus, as
before, reverses. The same is true if the rotation is about a sagittal
axis. These conditions were approximately realized by having the
subject sit as before on the rotary chair, but during the rotation
hold his head horizontally to the right or left, forward or back.
With any of these positions of the head, however, the rotation produced,
on all of the subjects tried, extreme dizziness and a feeling
of nausea that lasted in some cases for several hours. This fact
made it impossible to ask for a set of the four possible positions of
the head from any of the subjects. The following are the records
that were obtained:</p>

<p>So far as these records go, they entirely confirm the results of
other investigators as to the direction and the reversal of the nystagmus.
In each of the cases the after-image moved with the slow
eye-movements, reversing its direction with these slow movements,
while the visual field whenever it was observed (the eyes were kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
closed during the rotation) moved in the opposite direction to that
of the after-image and the slow eye-movement. It is well known
that after-images move <em>with</em> every involuntary eye-movement, and
although they disappear during voluntary eye-jumps,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> they reappear
at the end of the jump in a position that is related to the new
fixation-point exactly as the old position was to the former fixation-point.
These after-images, then, are seen during the slow eye-movements
whose direction they follow; but are not seen during the
quick movements, when they must naturally move in the direction
of these quick movements. And aside from this it is possible to observe
introspectively that the after-image disappears at that side
of the visual field toward which the slow eye-movements tend, and
is for a moment invisible before it reappears on the other side of
the field. As was shown above, the visual field always moves opposite
to the direction of the slow eye-movements, as must of course
be the case if there is no inhibition of vision during these movements.
The simultaneous appearance of the after-image moving
with, and the rest of the visual field moving contrary to, the direction
of the slow eye-movements, with a uniform absence of the converse
phenomena, seems to prove that vision is unimpaired during
these slow movements, while it is completely inhibited during the
rapid phases of the nystagmus.</p>

<p>Purkinje himself<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> called the slower phases "involuntary and
unconscious," meaning by "unconscious" not that the visual
field was not seen (for it just then is seen), but that the movement
of the eyeball during the slow phases was not felt. I have observed,
with the confirmation of several subjects, that <em>this</em> movement can
also not voluntarily be inhibited; whereas the swift movement is
so far voluntary that it can be inhibited at pleasure. It is possible,
that is, to fix the eyes on that side of the field toward which
the slow movements are directed, but not on any point at the other
side of the field. The slow movements, then, during which vision
is possible, are purely reflex. These slow movements, purely reflex
and yielding clear vision, with the rapid movements, partly
under voluntary control and attended by an inhibition of vision,
present a parallelism, that may be not without significance, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
"pursuit" eye-movements (Dodge's "second type"), that are likewise
relatively slow, are reflex, and yield remarkably clear vision,
and the ordinary voluntary eye-jumps (Dodge's "first type"), that
are relatively rapid, and are, like the rapid nystagmiform movements,
attended by a central inhibition of vision.</p>

<h2>VISUAL IRRADIATION</h2>

<p class="p1b">BY FOSTER PARTRIDGE BOSWELL</p>


<p>There are various kinds of visual irradiation, of which perhaps the
best-known variety is that which appears as the enlargement of a
brightly illuminated surface at the expense of a contiguous one of less
intensity. This has been until recently the only form recognized, and
until very lately the greater part of the literature has dealt with it
alone.</p>

<p>The whole subject was carefully investigated by Plateau in 1831,
and retinal irradiation extricated from phenomena which very often
accompany it. He showed that the extent of irradiation varies with
the intensity of the stimulating light and the time during which it is
allowed to act. He was also the first to call attention to the phenomenon
of so-called negative irradiation.</p>

<p>Somewhat later Volkman again called attention to negative irradiation,
while Aubert, in opposing the explanation advanced by Volkman,
first showed the relations existing between irradiation and contrast.</p>

<p>Dove was the first to investigate the influence of irradiation on stereoscopic
pictures, thus calling attention to the question of binocular irradiation.
Experiments in this direction, however, have in general given
negative results in so far as any enlargement of the binocular portion
is concerned.</p>

<p>Helmholtz examined the manner in which the stimulation at the
border-line between a light and dark field changes in intensity, and
drew a curve showing these modifications of intensity due to irradiation.
Hering showed that the form of the Helmholtz intensity curve
would be modified by the presence of other phenomena not strictly
those of irradiation.</p>

<p>De Roux demonstrated the difference in the extent of a real induction
on the foveal and the extra-foveal parts of the retina.</p>

<p>Charpentier has attempted to carry forward the general explanation
by saying that this spreading of neural excitation, the existence of
which he proves to be beyond question, takes the form of an undulatory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
excitation in the free nerve-endings of the retina. Bidwell
has investigated more thoroughly in some respects than Charpentier
the phenomena of the after-images of moving sources of light, which
have bearing upon irradiation. The same is true with regard to
McDougall, von Kries, Hess, and others. Burch has instituted investigations
along these lines, especially concerning the inhibition of
stimuli on contiguous portions of the retina. Hess has worked carefully
upon the different phases of the stimulation derived from a moving
source of light, the differences in functioning of the foveal and extra-foveal
parts of the retina, the respective functions of the rods and
cones, and in connection with this, made investigations in the visual
perception of color-blind subjects. All these observations have
important bearing on irradiation, contrast, and theories of
color-vision.</p>

<p>In connection with some work which was being done upon the after-images
of moving sources of light in the Harvard laboratory in the
early winter of 1903, some phenomena were observed which I believe
are due to one form or other of visual irradiation. They can be seen in
various ways, perhaps most advantageously by observing with fixed
eyes the passage of a luminous image over the retina. What one sees
as such a figure moves by is a travelling band of light, its forefront
somewhat like that of the stimulating source, the rest composed of
a long train of after-images which differ very decidedly from one
another in intensity and color. The advantage of this well-known
method of observation lies in the fact that it enables one to translate
the temporal relations between the different phases of the stimulation
into spatial relations between the different portions of the moving
band of light. For since the figure moves across in a plane before the
observer, that which appears in his consciousness first in time will
likewise appear as foremost on the plane in space. Thus by observing
the train of images one practically sees the different phases of the
stimulation spread out in order before one. The new phenomena we
observed, however, have to do with but a single phase of the stimulation,
the extreme front of the stimulating image.</p>

<p>The intensity of light used varied considerably with the differently
colored images, and was regulated so as to give as well as possible
the phenomena we wished to study. With white light the intensity
was less than that of an eight-candle-power electric lamp placed
about ten feet distant from the observer. When colored light was
employed it was necessary to use a very much stronger source of
illumination, since the colored glass which was used absorbed a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
deal of light and in case of colors lying toward the violet end of the
spectrum greater luminosity seemed demanded.</p>

<p>The apparatus used consisted of a three-foot pendulum with a screen
attached. This screen swung with the pendulum. In the screen was
an opening about four inches wide and three inches high, into which
strips of cardboard or tin backed by a piece of ground glass could be
slipped. In these strips differently shaped holes were made through
which the light passed. In this manner an image of any desired form
might be used. Behind the screen, between it and the lamp, was a
frame in which other pieces of ground or colored glass were placed.
These pieces of ground glass would reduce the intensity of the light
and diffuse it evenly over the image. The observer sat ten feet away.
When the pendulum was set in motion, the image would appear
moving back and forth in an arc. In order to shorten this arc and to
aid the observer in keeping his gaze perfectly fixed, a second screen
was placed before and very close to the pendulum, between it
and the observer. This screen was stationary. In it was a hole six
inches long and two inches wide. The top and bottom of this hole
were arcs of circles parallel with the arc in which the pendulum swung.
The ends were radii.</p>

<p>The screen was so placed with reference to the observer that the
moving image would pass directly across the middle of the opening,
appearing from behind one side and disappearing behind the other.
In the centre of the opening, directly in front of the place occupied by
the moving image when the pendulum was at rest, were two luminous
fixation-points, one above the other, below the path of the moving
light. In order to measure apparent spatial differences between the
phases of the stimulation, two wires were stretched vertically across
the opening in the stationary screen. These wires could be moved
nearer together or farther apart. Thus by measuring the apparent
distances in space between the different parts of the moving figure
a measure could be had of their temporal differences in coming into
consciousness. The luminous image moved, during the time it was
visible, at a velocity of about one and a quarter feet per second. Since
the observer sat about ten feet from the instrument, this would be at an
angular velocity of about seven degrees per second. In one experiment
a higher and a lower velocity were also employed.</p>

<p>It was of course very easy to change the figures and vary them
widely in form, color, and intensity. Most of those employed,
however, were rather small, subtending an angular distance of not
more than one degree. Since the whole opening did not subtend an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
angle of more than three degrees or so, nearly all the phases of the
stimulation occurred at the fovea.</p>

<p>We noticed that the form of the stimulating images themselves
seemed to suffer modification as the light swung by, not only because
of the train of after-images which dragged behind them over the
retina, but in other ways as well. For instance, a circular image
(Plate III, Fig. 1) appeared crescent-shaped, and its forward edge
possessed greater curvature than the segment of the circle which produced
it. It was longer also from horn to horn than the diameter of
the generating circle, and a faint haze surrounded the points extending
outward and backward until lost in the blackness of the background.
Von Kries remarks that a circular moving image appears cylindrical
in form with a concave edge behind. By using a little higher speed we
observed this phenomenon. At first we thought the crescent-shaped
image to be due merely to an intensely black after-process, which
Bidwell describes as following the positive image of a bright white
light. This, taking place before the circular disc of light had gone
forward a distance equal to its own diameter, would overlap the bright
image from behind and a crescent-shaped figure would result, but the
increase in width and convexity of the stimulating image as well as the
laterally trailing clouds of light remained to be explained, and as this
could not be done in terms of anything which might happen to the
back of the image, another explanation had to be sought. In order to
determine the effect of the form of the figure used as a source of light
on the form of the apparent image, several differently shaped figures
were employed. In place of the original circle, an oblong pointed at
both ends was tried (Plate III, Fig. 2). The front of this figure appeared
very convex indeed, while the ends, which, owing to the shape
of the figure, were very much less effective as a stimulating source,
trailed far behind the centre.</p>

<p>A crescent-shaped figure (Plate III, Fig. 4) gave rise to a very pretty
phenomenon. When it moved toward its concave side, it appeared
very much less concave on that side than the real figure, but when it
moved the other way, toward its convex side, it seemed very much
more curved than it was in reality.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img  src="images/img006.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="caption">P<span class="smcapa">LATE</span> III.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>No. 3, a simple oblong figure, appeared curved like the others,
almost as perfect a crescent as any of them.</p>

<p>The idea occurred to me that perhaps all these modifications in the
curvature of the figures could be explained if we assumed two things:
First: that there is a spreading of excitation from one portion of the
retina to another. Each point will therefore be stimulated not only
by the light falling directly upon it, but it will also derive a certain
reÃ«nforcement of its stimulation from the points surrounding it. Thus
a point lying toward the centre of one of these figures would be more
favorably situated for receiving reÃ«nforcement than one located toward
the periphery, where there are few neighboring points, and those lying
mostly in one direction, namely, toward the centre.</p>

<p>This may be represented diagramatically, as in the illustration
(Plate IV, Fig. 10), where the horizontal coÃ¶rdinates represent the
spatial dimensions of an oblong image and the vertical coÃ¶rdinates the
intensity of the excitation due to direct stimulation and its reÃ«nforcement
by surrounding points at various portions of the figure.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Secondly
I assumed that the stimulation at one part of the figure being thus
rendered more intense, that part would appear in consciousness more
quickly than the others and cause a modification in the form of the
figure.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> For example, in the case of the oblong figure, the light would
be rendered most intense at the centre and less and less intense toward
the ends, for the points in the centre of the figure will have their
intensity increased by nervous excitation spreading to them from
points lying toward the ends. Those toward the ends will be reÃ«nforced
by light coming only from toward the centre. Thus the intensity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
of the centre of the figure will be increased, and as the figure
moves across before the observer, the centre, appearing first in consciousness,
would likewise appear foremost in space, the points near
the centre a little later and so on, until finally, the ends being the last to
appear, the whole front of the figure would take the form of a convex
curve, after the manner in which it was observed. The back of the
figure also appears curved, probably because of the fact that the front
of the negative after-image, which closely follows it, is of the same
shape as the front of the positive image, as was shown in the case of
the circular figure.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>It is of course a well-known psychological fact that a light of greater
intensity will take less time in coming into consciousness than one of
less intensity. In this case, however, it was necessary to find some way
of showing such differences between lights which were very little
different in intensity. For one is practically unable to see any difference
in intensity between the parts of a stationary image. So unless it
could be shown that a difference in intensity between two sources of
illumination, so small as to be imperceptible to the observer, will
nevertheless make its presence known by the appearance of the brighter
light in consciousness before the other, the explanation which I have
suggested for the curvature of the images would have to be abandoned.</p>

<p>The following experiments do show, as I believe, that of two sources
of light not perceptibly different in intensity, the brighter will appear
in consciousness before the other, and that in the case of these figures
the curvature of the image is due to a heightened intensity of the light
in the centre through reÃ«nforcement of the excitation there present by
stimulation spreading from the ends.</p>


<p class="p2b">E<span class="smcapa">XPERIMENT</span> I</p>

<p>In the first of these experiments three dots of about three sixteenths
of an inch were placed in a vertical row about three eighths of an inch
apart (Plate IV, Fig. 1). No change was then observed in the form
of the figure. The row of dots swung across the opening in a perfectly
vertical line one directly above the other (Plate IV, Fig. 2). They were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
presumably too far apart for irradiation to take place between them.
When, however, another dot was interposed between each end dot and
the centre dot (Plate IV, Fig. 3), so that the excitement could extend
from one dot to the next, the front of the line of dots no longer appeared
vertical, but decidedly convex, the centre dot being perhaps
three eighths of an inch before the dots on the ends (Plate IV, Fig. 4).</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img  src="images/img007.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="caption">P<span class="smcapa">LATE</span> IV.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Absolutely the only difference between the two cases was that in
the one, irradiation presumably could not occur, while in the other it
conceivably could.</p>


<p class="p2b">E<span class="smcapa">XPERIMENT</span> II</p>

<p>In the second of these experiments the curvature of a line of dots
was observed and measured. Then the centre dots were slightly
darkened (Plate IV, Fig. 5) by shading lightly with a lead pencil the
ground glass which travelled with the pendulum and held in place the
card from which the dots were cut, until the front of the image lost its
curvature and appeared vertical (Plate IV, Fig. 6). The pendulum was
then stopped and the row of dots observed closely, in order to see
whether the dots in the centre were perceptibly of less intensity than
those on the ends. No perceptible difference was found.</p>


<p class="p2b">E<span class="smcapa">XPERIMENT</span> III</p>

<p>All the dots were covered, except the shaded central and the two
unshaded end dots, in order that no irradiation might take place
between them (Plate IV, Fig. 7). The pendulum was again set in
motion, and the centre dot, instead of remaining co-linear with the
dots on the ends, appeared considerably behind them (Plate IV, Fig.
3). This would show that irradiation must heighten the intensity of the
excitation in the centre of the figure&mdash;for the two cases just mentioned
are alike in every respect except that in the first (Fig. 6), where the
dots were near enough together so that irradiation might occur
between them, the intensity of the centre dot, which was objectively
fainter than the end dots, was heightened enough by this induced
excitation to appear in consciousness as soon as the two end dots,
which were objectively of greater intensity; whereas in the second
case (Fig. 7), where the dots were too far apart for irradiation to take
place between them, the centre dot, being objectively of less intensity
than the end dots, appeared behind them.</p>

<p>These experiments show that of two sources of light very little
different in intensity the brighter will appear in consciousness before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
the other. Other things being equal, the difference in intensity may
even be so small as to be imperceptible by direct comparison; it is
able nevertheless to make its presence known by the order in which
the lights appear. Exner made some experiments in 1868 to determine
the time necessary for the perception of lights of different intensity.
He used, however, stationary images of brief duration and tried to
eliminate the effects of the after-image by flooding the visual field with
light. This method has its disadvantages. It is incapable of measuring
the minute temporal differences in latent perception of sources of
light very slightly different in intensity.</p>

<p>While my method does not give the absolute time taken by any one
light to enter consciousness, it is a very much more delicate method
than Exner's for measuring <em>differences</em> in time of latent perception
of sources of light very close to one another in intensity. It would be
a very easy matter, having found the time of latent perception for a
light of standard intensity, to determine by this method the time
of lights of greater or less intensity.</p>

<p>These experiments also show that when irradiation is absent, the
curvature of the images is absent; when irradiation is presumably
present, curvature is present. For I find, not only in these, but also in
a number of other experiments, that under all conditions in which
the presence of irradiation is to be expected, the form of the images
tends to be modified in precisely the manner that the assumption of
its presence would lead one to anticipate. In all cases where irradiation
is presumably absent, the contour of the front of the moving
figure depends entirely on the amount of light proceeding from its
different parts.</p>

<p>It is next in order to say something of the physiological causes of
the phenomena we have been considering.</p>

<p>It is probable from what has been observed that in the case of the
curved figures we are dealing with a form of visual irradiation which
is due to the spreading of neural excitation over or through the layers
of the retina. It is also evident from the close connection between
irradiation and intensity that it must be of such a kind that the excitation
produced in one part of the retina may communicate itself readily
to another part. We have also seen in the case of the moving line of
dots that the several dots could remain distinct from one another and
yet could reÃ«nforce each other by means of communicated excitation.
It must also be a very rapid form of irradiation, for the curvature of
the figures does not increase very much during the time they are
visible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>I think that the demands made by these different facts are best met
by assuming that the spread of the nervous excitation which gives the
reÃ«nforcement takes place in one of the interconnecting layers of nerve
cells and fibres underlying the rods and cones. The line of dots which
appeared curved and yet perfectly distinct from one another could
very well communicate excitation to one another along these fibrils,
and the intensity of one part be raised by the excitation of the near-lying
parts. The fact that the dots remain distinct would not be contradictory.
For in that case very near-lying parts might communicate
excitation to one another without arousing to any very great activity
the nerves that lead to the brain from the small unstimulated portions
which lie between them. In this manner the intensity of the centre dots
could be heightened enough to make the row appear convex, without
any merging into one another on the part of the several dots. The
fact that the dots do not fuse shows that the curvature is not due
merely to a forward-spreading of the excitation in the retina. However,
there is always a certain amount of light visible between the dots, with
all the colors. This is especially noticeable with green light.</p>

<p>The fact that the elements of the retina form a kind of concatenated
series from without inwards, a number of rods and cones corresponding
to but one ganglion cell, furnishes a further bit of evidence in
support of the explanation just advocated, since the irradiated excitation
would tend to be "drained off" through the group of ganglion
cells corresponding to the most highly stimulated portions and leave
the intervening spaces comparatively free from centrally proceeding
excitation. Thus also the individual dots in the five-dot figures may
appear entirely distinct from one another and yet the centre ones be
reÃ«nforced enough by irradiation to appear in consciousness in advance
of the others.</p>


<p class="p6">SUBSIDIARY EXPERIMENTS</p>

<p>A number of other observations were made which present various
exemplifications of the principles we have considered.</p>


<p class="p2b">E<span class="smcapa">XPERIMENT</span> IV</p>

<p>An oblong figure, all its parts objectively of the same intensity, had
its ends slightly darkened. When this was done the curvature had
increased from twelve sixteenths to fourteen sixteenths of an inch.</p>

<p>The pendulum was stopped, and a very slight difference was perceived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
between the ends and the centre of the figure. This difference
in intensity was greater than in the dot experiment, when the image
had been darkened enough in the centre to make it appear vertical,
because in this case, when the ends were darkened the centre would
still be reÃ«nforced by irradiation from a considerable space which
intervened between the shading and the centre.</p>


<p class="p2b">E<span class="smcapa">XPERIMENT</span> V</p>

<p>The centre of the oblong figure was considerably darkened so as
to counteract the effect of induction. By properly varying the amount
of shading, one may make the front of the
figure appear less convex, vertical, or even
concave. This shows perfectly the effect
of differences in intensity upon the curvature
of the figure, but does not show
so neatly as the similar experiments performed
with the dots, the influence of the
presence or absence of irradiation upon
the intensity of the centre of the figure
and so upon the curvature.</p>

<p>The illustration shows a case where
the centre was too much darkened.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img  src="images/img008.jpg" alt="Experiment V" />
</div>

<p>The two ends were comparatively free
from shading. In each end-part irradiation
took place. The points lying toward
the centres of these ends received reÃ«nforcement,
both from points lying toward
the centre of the figure and from the extreme ends, and so the centres
of the ends of the image were considerably brighter than either the
extreme ends of the figure itself, or the sides of the end-parts toward
the heavily shaded centre of the figure. Accordingly each end appeared
convex for a short distance. The whole figure, however, being considerably
brighter at the two ends than at the centre, on account of the
heavy shading, the ends appeared in consciousness first and the centre
afterwards, so that the figure as a whole seemed concave.</p>


<p class="p2b">E<span class="smcapa">XPERIMENT</span> VI</p>

<p>An oblong figure was shaded rather heavily at one end, gradually
becoming lighter toward the other, while about a third of the figure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
was free from shading. The shaded end always seemed to lag behind.
The extreme front of the figure was at a point a little distance from
the other end, before the shaded portion began. So that the front of
the whole figure appeared, not like a segment of a circle, but like part
of an oval with the bulge toward the brighter end.</p>

<p>Beyond the ends of all these images faint clouds of light were seen,
as has been mentioned before, extending outward and backward,
gradually decreasing in intensity, until lost in the surrounding blackness
of the background.</p>

<p>Charpentier's bands, sometimes more and sometimes less in number,
were observable in all of my figures and with all colors. Very often
they appeared to be parallel to the forefront of the image, or even
of a slightly greater degree of curvature.</p>


<p class="p2b">E<span class="smcapa">XPERIMENT</span> VII</p>

<p>It is a well-known fact that a rotating color-disc, having colors which
just fuse at a certain intensity, will show flicker at a slightly less
intensity.</p>

<p>A color-disc was set in motion and the speed found where the colors
were on the point of fusing. A piece of black cardboard, with a hole
about an inch in diameter, was held close to the screen.</p>

<p>Around the periphery of the hole flickering appeared, while at the
centre there was fusion. (The cardboard was held very close to the
disc, so that there would be no shadows on the disc near its edges.)
This fusion at the centre of the disc is probably due to the fact that
the centre of the field is of slightly greater intensity than the edges,
owing to irradiation. This difference in intensity makes the difference
between the fusion at the centre and the slight flicker seen at the
periphery.</p>

<p>Karl Marbe in a recent article mentions the difference in fusion
between a point in the centre of the disc and a point near its border,
and he thinks the increase of flickering in the latter is due to some
influence on the part of the moving edge which separates the different
parts of the disc. It would seem more probable from this last experiment
that the fusion at the centre of the field of view was due to reÃ«nforcement
of intensity by irradiation, and that the flicker about the
periphery of the field was due to the lack of such reÃ«nforcement.</p>

<p>Three large dots were used and the centre one covered with tissue
paper. The two end dots then appeared ahead of the centre dots.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
They were larger than the centre dot, due to irradiation over their
borders. But this increase in size did not account for their position
ahead in space. The centres of all the dots were not co-linear, but the
middle dot was behind the others, thus, of course, showing the greater
time necessary for the perception of the less luminous object.</p>

<p>This was exactly similar to the preceding, except that the intensities
of the various dots were reversed. The end dots were covered with
tissue paper, instead of the centre one. Then the
centre dot appeared first and the end dots after it.</p>

<p>Professor Hess finds that an image which, compared
to those we used, was very long, subtending
an angular distance of about thirty degrees, and
which extends entirely across the fovea and overlaps
the surrounding parts of the retina will appear
curved backwards at the fovea, owing to the longer
time of latent perception of the fovea and the macula.
The accompanying illustration shows a modification
of one of Hess's figures, in which the presence
of this phenomenon and that of the convex
image are both shown. The two phenomena were
observed when a two-inch image was observed at
a distance of about fourteen inches. The intensity
of the light was that of an eight-candle-power lamp
with three pieces of ground glass in front of it.
(Very many of Hess's intensities are too great to
give convex images.) Thus the image would be
about 12&deg; in height. About 5/12 of the figure would
then fall on the macula and fovea and appear
curved backwards in relation to the ends. The
ends where they fell on the extra foveal parts of
the retina appeared convex in front and concave
at the rear as any small image of the right intensity
does which falls on a homogeneous part of the retina.</p>

<p>Charpentier, Bidwell, and others have made the observation that
if a small source of light be exposed for a brief interval, excitation
will proceed out in all directions over the retina, but if the light be
exposed for a slightly longer period, the excitation will contract again
and the light appear nearly its proper size and in its proper location at
the stimulated portion of the retina. Using variously shaped figures
we obtained analogous results, and the additional fact appeared that
the outgoing excitation proceeds from the borders of the figures and
that its form is somewhat determined by the form of the figure. An
oblong image appeared vaguely elliptical, a diamond-shaped figure in
the form of a more pointed ellipse, etc. These images were exposed for
only a small fraction of a second, by means of a shutter. As the exposure
grew longer the true form of the figures came out more and more
clearly. There thus seems to be a general spreading of the stimulation
in all directions over the retina from the borders of the images. Then,
upon a slightly longer duration of the stimulus, this very rapid irradiation
of excitation contracts and the irradiation becomes confined
within the borders of the stimulated portion and affects the intensity
of the different portions of the image. With strong intensities and
certain colors it is, however, never wholly confined to the stimulated
portion even of moving images. Charpentier speaks of "clouds of
light accompanying his figures." With green light these clouds are
especially noticeable. His "palm branch" phenomenon is a good
instance of the irradiation of stimulation.</p>

<p>Besides these experiments which I have just described, several
phenomena of a like sort were observed in connection with other
experiments which were being performed in the laboratory at the
same time. Dr. Holt was experimenting with a bright circular spot
of light about one half inch in diameter, surrounded by a very faint
ring about one half inch wide. When the whole image was moved
about, the spot would seem to go back and forth across the less intense
part so that the whole image looked like a jelly-fish swimming about
in the water.</p>

<p>When the figure was allowed to remain stationary for a few moments
it would resume its natural shape. Otherwise the bright part
would seem to advance faster than the rest, sometimes even overlapping
the border. This phenomenon was due to the fact that a bright
light requires less time in coming into consciousness than a less
intense one, and is, of course, the same in principle as those which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
were performed with dots when the bright dot moved ahead of the
rest.</p>

<p>Another one of these phenomena occurred when an isosceles triangle
was moved in a direction parallel to its base. The side toward
which it moved appeared curved forward, with the apex bent backward.
Toward the bottom, where there was the best chance for irradiation
to have its effect, appeared the most advanced portion of the
figure, while the bottom corner, although objectively the most advanced
part of the figure, appeared rounded off and somewhat behind
the part just above.</p>

<p>A narrow, vertical image with a large bulge behind the central
part appeared with a large portion of this bulge in advance of the
centre of the figure.</p>

<p>All these experiments show that a more intense object is, other
things being equal, always located ahead of other objects co-linear
with it. And I assume irradiation to account for the priority in localization
of parts of the figure which are not objectively of greater
intensity than others, but whose position makes them subject to reÃ«nforcement.
The localization itself may be a function of more central
organs, and not directly a question of the coming into consciousness
more quickly of a more intense stimulation, although that seems to
be the simplest explanation, but in any case priority of localization
varies directly with the degree of intensity.</p>

<p>If the light is not bright enough to produce much irradiation the
image will lose its curvature. If the light is too bright, although there
may be a maximum of irradiation aroused and the absolute difference
in intensity between the ends and centre of the image be at its greatest,
yet this difference may not be great enough in proportion to the
absolute intensity of the light to make the centre of the image appear
in advance of the rest.</p>

<p>The curvature also varies with the angle subtended by the image
and the portion of the retina upon which the image falls. If the image
were too long, although all the processes which produce curvature be
present, yet the front of the image would still appear vertical, because
of the fact that each point in this long line would not derive reÃ«nforcement
sensibly greater than that of the neighboring points. The best
one could expect would be that these long figures should have their
ends rounded off, which is usually the case. Most of the images which
Professor Hess used in his experiments were too long to appear curved.
All the images whose curvature we measured did not subtend an angle
greater than 1&deg; 10Â´, and were all seen on the fovea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>An image which subtends an angle of more than about 2&deg; will
hardly appear curved when it passes over the fovea.</p>

<p>We were sometimes able to see the curvature reversed. This happened
in my own case about once in a hundred times, usually when
my eyes were fatigued by the repeated passing of the moving light
back and forth over the same portion of the retina. With other
observers it occurred more often.</p>

<p>Slight vertical differences in fixation would cause the central part
of the path taken by the moving light to become more fatigued than
the edges and so to respond more slowly to the stimulation and reverse
the curvature. It may be that some brain process which has to do with
the apperception of the form and movement of visual objects becomes
fatigued or does not always function properly, and so the curvature
of the image may sometimes appear reversed. At any rate the more
usual cases are those in which the convexity is present. The others,
owing to the number of factors involved, and the vast majority of the
opposite cases, may be regarded as due to temporary defects in the
psycho-physical mechanism, which when properly working would give
the more usual result.</p>

<p>The object of the following experiments was to measure the amount
of curvature produced by differing degrees of intensity of light at different
speeds. An oblong figure was employed one fourth inch wide
and two inches long. As has been mentioned, two vertical wires were
stretched across the path in which the light moved. As the light
swung by, it was attempted to get the wires at such a distance from one
another that when one appeared tangent to the curve at the front of
the figure the other would seem to cross the image at the point of
intersection of the curve with the rest of the figure, as indicated in the
diagram. (<a href="#Page_80">Plate IV, Fig. 9.</a>)</p>

<p>The distance between the wires was then read off on a scale. Thus
one was able to obtain a measure of the curvature of the figure when
it was moving at different speeds and illuminated by different intensities
of light, and to compare the observations of different subjects. The
mean error in this work is surprisingly little, considering the difficulties
in making the judgment as the light passed rapidly by the wires.
Usually the moving light had to be observed several times before the
curvature of the front of the moving image could be measured exactly.
It would be perfectly obvious that the front was considerably curved,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
but it would often be wholly impossible to tell just how much it was
curved, until the pendulum had swung back and forth four or five
times. Fatigue and darkness adaptation modify the judgments considerably.
If one's eyes were partially adapted to darkness some little
difficulty was experienced in seeing clearly the curvature of the image.
Fatigue comes on very rapidly indeed. Usually it was impossible to
get more than four judgments without resting, and often only two
could be made. It was sometimes impossible to measure the curvature
at the exact point when the light passed under the cross-wires, so the
curvature had to be observed carefully and compared with the distance
between the wires, and a judgment made when the wires were
not superimposed upon the image. With each intensity of light two
judgments were taken, one when the cross-wires had to be brought
nearer together, the other when they had to be moved farther apart.
Several series of measurements were made by different observers, and
the results averaged up and compared.</p>

<p>The following curves and tables give the different observations for
the nine different intensities of white light,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and the three speeds
which were used. In the case of the high speed the light moved across
the opening in the screen placed before the pendulum at a velocity
of about 1.5 ft. per sec. The middle speed was about 1.27 ft. per sec.
and the low speed about .917 feet per sec. In all cases an oblong
image was used, &frac14; inch wide and 2 inches long. The numerals on the
left of the plotted curves give the apparent curvature of the image in
sixteenths of an inch, and were obtained by measuring the distance
between the cross-wires when this distance measured the apparent
curvature of the image in the way described above. The figures at the
bottom designate the different intensities of light which were used.
Number one is the greatest intensity, number nine the least; the others
those in between.</p>

<p><em>High Speed.</em> This curve shows very well indeed what seems to be
typical of the relations between the intensity of the moving light and
the apparent curvature of the front edge of the image. With the lowest
degrees of intensity the amount of the curvature is very little. Sometimes
it was difficult to measure it at all. The light was so faint and
the speed so rapid that probably very little reÃ«nforcement or irradiation
took place, although what did occur would show its presence
most prominently, since, on account of the high speed at which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
pendulum moved, any part of the
image which should come into consciousness
ahead of the rest, even
by a very little time, would appear
considerably in advance of the rest
of the image in space. Of course a
certain amount of time would be
required for the stimulus to spread
itself over the retina, since it has to
overcome a certain amount of resistance
in the nerve-layers, and if this
time were not given, the curvature
of the resulting image would be of
course decreased. As the light brightened,
however, the curvature increased
rapidly, until finally, when
the intensity of the light neared its
highest point, the curvature ceased
becoming greater, and finally decreased. The mean error in eight
judgments taken by two people for each intensity of light was about
.099 in.</p>

<p>The measurements with the middle speed were very similar. The
curvature with the lowest intensity of light was somewhat greater than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
when this same light moved with the highest speed. The maximum
point of curvature was reached with a light of less intensity, and the
curvature was less. When yet higher intensities were used, the curve
decreased rapidly. The amount of curvature was also much less with
the brightest light than with the higher speed. The following table
shows the judgments of three observers for this speed:</p>

<p>The low-speed measurements show the same general tendencies
except that the curvature is smaller with this speed when the faintest
lights were used than with any of the others. The maximum curvature
is also less and occurs with a more intense light than with the middle
speed. These modifications offer no special difficulties. Since the
light moves slowly, although the centre of the image, which is reÃ«nforced
by induced excitation from the ends, does appear in consciousness
in time ahead of the rest of the image, yet it does not appear so far
in advance of the rest of the figure in space as it would if the light
moved with a higher speed. While the same difference in brightness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
between the centre and the ends of the image should make one part
appear in consciousness just as far ahead of the rest in time with this
speed as with any other, yet since the speed is slow it would not appear
to be so far ahead in space. The fact that the maximum amount of
apparent curvature is less would also be explained in the same manner.</p>

<p>When the high and middle speeds were used the results were surprisingly
consistent and the variations between the observers not very
great. With the low speed the individual differences are very much
more prominent. Uncertainties and variations between observers and
between different observations of the same observer became greater
and greater as the intensity of the light decreased. One seemed to be
approaching the lower limit of induction, below which, even if the
spreading of light stimuli through the retina took place at all, it was
to such a slight extent that it made no very marked difference in the
appearance of the moving image. Individual differences are very great
in this respect. For instance, my own average measurement was
15&frasl;64 in. of curvature for the image produced when a light of the lowest
intensity moved at the lowest speed. Mr. Vaughan's measurements
averaged 30&frasl;64 in., a measurement of just twice as much for the same
light at the same speed.</p>

<p>So far there has been given only a general view of what happens
when an oblong moving image appears convexly curved. It may be
well to consider the different causes which determine a certain curvature
of the image and see how they are related.</p>

<p>As we have seen, the curvature is a function of the difference in
intensity of various excitations between the centre and the ends of the
retinal area excited. This difference is modified both by the objective
intensity of the light and by the speed at which the light moves. Its
efficiency to produce curvature is also modified by both these factors,
since it requires a certain small amount of time for the irradiation to
take place. If this time is not given by the too rapid passage of the
image over a certain part of the retina, the difference in intensity will
be lessened and the curvature therefore be decreased. On the other
hand, if the figure moves too slowly, although this difference in intensity
may be as great as possible for the brightness of the light which
is acting, yet the curvature may be lessened on account of the fact
that, although the centre of the image does appear ahead of the ends
in time, yet it does not appear so far ahead of the ends of the image in
space as it would if the same difference in intensity were present and
the image moved more rapidly.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that the intensity of the centre of the figure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
owes its increase to reÃ«nforcement by excitation irradiating from the
surrounding points. It seems only reasonable to suppose that this
added intensity due to irradiation does not increase without limit, or
with exactly the required ratio to produce a curvature of the front of
the image which becomes continuously greater as the intensity of the
light increases, indefinitely.</p>

<p>If this be so, then, at a certain brightness, the difference in intensity
between the ends and the centre of the image will have reached a
maximum, and a further increase in brightness of the light will not
serve to increase the apparent curvature of the image, but rather to
decrease it.</p>


<p class="p2b">C<span class="smcapa">OLOR</span> I<span class="smcapa">RRADIATION</span></p>

<p>The color of the image has a decided influence upon the amount
of perceived curvature, independently of the intensity.</p>

<p>The following experiments were performed with lights of different
colors, in order to investigate the relations between the kinds and
amounts of irradiation of the different colors by comparing the
amounts of the curvatures obtained. We encountered a good deal of
difficulty in fixing upon a proper method of comparison between the
different colors. Finally it was decided to use such intensities of light
as would give a maximum amount of curvature with each of the
four primary colors, to measure this amount in each case, and also
to measure the amount obtained when the intensity of the light was
greater and less than that required to give the maximum.</p>

<p>It was found that very different objective intensities of light were
required to give a maximum amount of curvature with the different
colors. The colored images were obtained by placing colored pieces
of glass in a frame which stood before the source of light. The intensity
of the light could be regulated by interposing or taking away
pieces of ground glass which rested in the frame between the light and
the colored glass.</p>

<p>The red glass gave a nearly saturated color, but its place in the
spectrum was rather nearer the orange than I could have wished. It
was a thick piece of glass and absorbed a great deal of light. A
32-candle-power light with four pieces of ground glass in front of it
gave a maximum curve for most observers.</p>

<p>The yellow gave a very well-saturated color with light from the
incandescent lamps which we used. The glass was thinner and
absorbed less light than the red. A 32-candle-power lamp with three
pieces of ground glass usually gave the maximum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>Two 32-candle-power lamps and one of 24-candle-power were
required with the green.</p>

<p>The green glass was not quite so saturated in color as the red or
yellow. It was a slightly yellowish green. Red and yellow rays were
visible through it to some extent when it was examined through the
spectroscope. It absorbed somewhat less light than the red and
decidedly more than the yellow. The maximum curvature was obtained
when the source of light was screened with four pieces of
ground glass.</p>

<p>The blue glass was a bluish violet, very heavy, and absorbed a great
deal of light; it allowed many red and violet rays to pass through. It
was necessary to use with this glass two 32-candle-power lamps and
one 100-candle-power. When the combined light of these lamps
was reduced by interposing three thicknesses of ground glass, the
maximum curvature was observed. The light which then appeared,
however, seemed of greater intensity than any other which gave a
maximum.</p>

<p>The curvature of the white light was measured again in order to
compare it with the colored lights. This was necessary, since the work
was done with a different set of subjects and the former work showed
individual variations. An 8-candle-power light was used as before.
This, reduced by four pieces of ground glass, gave the maximum in
most cases.</p>

<p>The following curves and tables show the average of the observations
of four subjects. In the table the figures under the columns
numbered 1 and 2 represent the amount of curvature perceived when
the intensity of light was greater than that required to give a maximum
under 4 and 5, when the light was not strong enough to produce a
maximum of curvature. The columns numbered 3 represent the
greatest amount of curvature perceptible with each color.</p>

<p>The curves shown in the diagram represent these measurements
plotted out.</p>

<p>The measurements were made in the same way as before, and are
given in sixteenths of an inch.</p>

<p>In the diagram the abscissas represent the different intensities, the
ordinates the amount of the curvature. To avoid confusion, the curve
of the average of all the colors is left out of this diagram.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img  src="images/img013.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>It will be noticed in these records that the different colors give very
different measurements of curvature. Green gives by far the largest,
being greater than any of the others at every point. Since the process
of obtaining the curvature was the same with all the colors, these
differences in curvature can only be due to inherent differences in the
processes which give the sensations of the different colors. It cannot
be due simply to one sort of intensity process, the same for all the colors,
otherwise the curvature of all the colors would be the same. At the
same time the curvature of the image is due to differences in intensity
of excitation between one part of the image and another. There must
be, therefore, a retinal excitation in some respects different for each
color, capable of its different degrees of intensity. Of course these
individual differences would have a decidedly limited range, for, as
every one knows, if the intensity of a color be increased sufficiently its
saturation vanishes and white appears in its place, while if the intensity
be decreased without limit, black appears. It may be that different
degrees of excitation in the different processes have different rates of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
time in coming into consciousness, so that an equal degree of difference
in excitation between the ends and centre of the green image and the
ends and centre of the red image would give decidedly different amounts
of curvature, if it took a longer time after the centre of the green image
had appeared in consciousness for the ends to appear than it did in
the case of the red.</p>

<p>The time-differences might be greater with the same differences in
intensities of excitation with one color and another. Or it may be that
the excitation spreads in a different manner with each one of the
colors, and therefore gives differing degrees of reÃ«nforcement with the
different colors, and thus produces different amounts of curvature.</p>

<p>It is noticeable also that the amounts of curvature are related to
one another in a peculiar way. Green has the greatest amount of
curvature, yellow the next. Red is greater than blue with the higher
intensities, they are equal at the maximum, and blue is greater than
red when the lower intensities are used.</p>

<p>When a spectrum showing a fair degree of saturation is observed, it
is seen that the point of greatest brightness lies in the yellows. As the
intensity is heightened, this point moves toward the red end, and as
it is lowered, it moves toward the blue.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the relation between the different amounts of
curvature for the different colors is the same as that between the different
degrees of apparent brightness when the intensity of the colors
in the spectrum is decreased. It is not that of the extreme case of the
phenomenon of Purkinje, but when the point of brightness has
moved from the yellow into the yellowish greens or decidedly to the
right of the place it occupies in the normal spectrum. In that case
yellow would be the color second in brightness. In our measurements
the amounts of curvature obtained from yellow images were next in
size to those of green. The red and the violet-blue which we used
would therefore be about equal. It is a noteworthy fact, however, that
when the intensities of light (1) and (2) are too great to give a maximum
of curvature the amount of curvature obtained with the red is
greater than that of the blue, while with the intensities which are too
small (4) and (5) to give a maximum the blue curve is greater than
the red.</p>

<p>As yet it has not been possible for me to find an interpretation of
these facts which would seem to meet all the requirements, and I
should not wish to offer any explanation at present. The question of
the possible connection of this phenomenon with Purkinje's is probably
important for any explanation, though it is possible that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
arrangement of the curves is merely a coincidence, yet this hardly
seems likely, and it would seem as if an explanation of the connection
would involve an attempt at explanation of Purkinje's phenomenon,
and lead at once into the most doubtful problems of the theory of
visual sensations.</p>

<p>It is also noticed that the series of numbers obtained when the
amounts of curvature of the different colored images, at the different
intensities given in the foregoing table, are averaged up, and the curve
of the average of all colors is thus obtained, that this average curve is
very like that obtained for the white light. These curves and the series
of numbers which they represent are here given.</p>

<p>It will be noticed, however, that the curve for the white light, while
nearly equal to that of the average for the colored lights at the maximum
point, nevertheless falls considerably below it at each end. This
may possibly be due to the fact that with white light it was only necessary
to use an 8-candle-power lamp as a source of light, so that when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
pieces of ground glass were interposed in order to reduce the intensity
of this light, very much greater reduction would occur with this comparatively
weak source than would take place with an objective source
of light of far greater brilliancy, as was the case with the colored lights.
Hence there would be a greater difference in absolute intensity between
intensities 1 and 3 with the white light than between intensities 1 and 3
with any of the colored lights, or that represented by their average.
Thus the falling of the curve of the white light at each end may possibly
be due to the fact that there is a greater difference in intensity
represented by these parts of the curve in the case of the white light
than is represented by the analogous portions of the curve of the average
of the colored lights.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that these measurements were obtained
when the image was upon the fovea, so that the white obtained
was "cone white," and not due in any way to the functioning of
the rods. It is interesting to note that the curve of the white is very
near that of the average curve of all the colors, though I should
hesitate to draw the conclusion from this that "cone white" is due
to a mixture or fusion of all the excitations corresponding to the
different colors.</p>

<p>In regard, however, to relations of the amounts of curvature of the
images, there are several further considerations which ought to be
noted. In the first place all three measurements were made when the
images were entirely on the fovea. In the fovea there are no rods, so,
whatever the connection of these facts with Purkinje's phenomenon, it
is one which has to do with the functions of the cones alone.</p>

<p>Professor Hess, in his experiments upon totally color-blind subjects,
found that exactly the same oscillatory processes in the course
of the stimulation occurred with them as with normal subjects. He
also found that the difference in the time of latent perception between
the foveal and extra-foveal parts was the same for one set of subjects
as for the other. The sole difference seemed to be in the one fact of not
being able to perceive colors. From these facts it does not look as if
the difference between seeing colors and color-blindness were by any
means always due to the absence of cones in the color-blind eye. It may
of course be true that an eye which is deficient in cones or which has a
lesion of the fovea would have poor color perception. But it seems also
true that an eye which, in so far as the rods and cones and their purely
retinal processes were concerned, seems to be normal in every way,
except perhaps that somewhat different intensities were required to
give the same reactions (which might be explained by different central<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
processes), may nevertheless belong to a person who is totally color-blind
or totally unable to perceive colors with that eye.</p>

<p>If this should prove true, the cones would still be regarded as the
end organs of color perception, but the cones would only give sensations
of color when functioning in conjunction with some other more
central process. The usual cases of color-blindness would be attributable,
not to any deficiency in the cones or any other retinal process, but
to a defect in this more central process, which, working in conjunction
with the cones, gives us our sensations of color.</p>

<p>The usual views of the functions of the rods would not be affected
by these considerations. They would continue to be regarded as end
organs whose main business it is to deal with weak stimulations and to
notice movement in objects whose images fall upon the periphery of
the retina.</p>

<p>But the main difference would be that all cases of partial color-blindness
and most cases of total color-blindness would be explained
by lesions in the brain rather than abnormalities of retinal structure.</p>

<p>The endeavor to explain these phenomena of moving images which
we have been considering and an examination of the literature of the
subject have led me to conclude that there are five distinct types of
irradiation. These are:</p>

<p>1. Irradiation &#945;. The very rapid spreading of the nervous excitation
over the retina, which extends far beyond the borders of the image
and which occurs immediately upon stimulation. It is most distinctly
observed with stationary sources of illumination of the briefest duration
perceptible. This kind of irradiation has been discussed at length
by Charpentier and Bidwell.</p>

<p>2. Irradiation &#946;. As the apparent form of the moving image becomes
distinctly perceptible, such irradiation takes place within the
confines of the stimulated portion of the retina, so as to make the
excitation present at favorably situated localities more intense than
that of other places. The portions which are so situated as to receive
this reÃ«nforcement are the first to enter consciousness. The various
phenomena discussed earlier in this paper furnish examples of this
process, as well as the phenomenon of the curved image.</p>

<p>3. Irradiation &#947;. After, and in part during, the rise and development
of the reÃ«nforcing irradiation, emanations of nervous excitation
of small intensity proceed from the borders of the stimulated portions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
and from the after-images, rapidly extending themselves over the
retina and gradually decreasing in intensity.</p>

<p>4. Irradiation &#948;. When two fields of different intensities are
brought into juxtaposition, the field having the greater intensity will
enlarge itself at the expense of the other. This constitutes what has
been usually termed irradiation, and is observable with stationary
objects. This enlargement varies with the time during which it is
observed, the absolute intensity of the light employed, and the relative
differences in intensity of the two fields. Its angular extent under
determinable conditions is constant, although it varies considerably
from one observer to another, and with the same observer at different
times. Its physiological explanation is probably similar to that of the
other kinds of irradiation, viz., the spreading of nervous excitation
over or through the layers of the retina, although various factors of
accommodation, dispersion, achromatism, astigmatism, etc., enter in
and modify the totality of the phenomenon. It will be noticed that
reÃ«nforcement occurs in this kind of irradiation as well as in certain of
the other forms. The sides of the dark fields upon which this form of
irradiation shows itself appear curved inward at the centre, apparently
showing the presence of a greater excitation in the lighter fields next
to the centre of the darker ones.</p>

<p>5. Irradiation &#949;. When a luminous object has been observed for
a long time (from thirty seconds to several minutes), the whole surrounding
field will be flooded by a faint haze of light, which within
certain limits increases in intensity the longer the stimulation is
present. This phase has many characteristics of the first and most
rapid kind of irradiation, and possibly represents a discontinuance
of functioning, through fatigue of certain nervous mechanisms which
prevent the spreading, or inhibit the perception, of this irradiatory
excitation after the form of the object is distinguished clearly. It is
probably largely due to such a mechanism that we are enabled to
perceive as clearly and sharply as we do the outlines of objects which
differ greatly in intensity from their backgrounds.</p>

<p>W. McDougall has developed a theory of inhibition<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> which he
uses to explain the more usual kinds of irradiation. This explanation
harmonizes very well with the results of my own experiments and
helps to explain all the kinds of irradiation we have distinguished.
Briefly stated the theory of inhibition is this: there is a transference
of nervous excitation or energy through the nerves and from one
neurone to another. This living nervous energy he calls neurin. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
place where it crosses from one neurone to another he calls the
synapse.</p>

<p>Of course these conceptions are not to be taken too literally. They
seem to be rather, if they are to be of any value at all, a convenient
way of handling certain neurological processes of which at present
we know very little, but whose grosser modes of action are comprehended
more easily by the use of such terms as "resistance,"
"neurin," etc. It is in this manner that I wish to be understood in
the use I have made of Dr. McDougall's valuable contributions to
the methodology of the subject.</p>

<p>Neurin is generated when a stimulus is applied to the afferent
nerves. When a strong stimulus is applied, neurin is generated rapidly,
and discharges across the synapse to the efferent neurone in a series
of very rapid discharges like the multiple discharge of a Leyden jar.
When the stimulus is weak the discharges take place more slowly.
Consciousness occurs at the time of the discharges and occurs in
pulses. When these pulses occur in very rapid succession we experience
a continuous sensation, when the discharges take place at a lower
rate we are conscious of a pulsative sensation, as for instance, in the
visual phenomenon of Charpentier's bands.</p>

<p>Continuance of stimulation continues to produce neurin, but the
multiple discharges caused by the incoming neurin cause fatigue in
the synapses, and the neurin seeks new paths of discharge through
unfatigued synapses.</p>

<p>The resistance of the synapses is first lowered by the incoming
neurin, then raised again through fatigue. When the resistance is first
lowered upon application of the stimulus, the neurin which might go
through other channels of discharge is "drained off" through the
synapses which have their resistance thus lowered, then as the resistance
is again raised through fatigue, it again seeks discharge through
synapses which are unfatigued.</p>

<p>Applying these conceptions to the different kinds of irradiation we
have distinguished, we can bring them all under one category. One
might remark in passing that, in so far as our purposes are concerned,
it makes very little difference whether we regard consciousness as
occurring upon the crossing of neurin from one neurone to another, or
upon the charging and discharging of a cortical cell, so long as the
conditions already referred to are maintained, viz., first, a lowering of
resistance as the incoming nervous excitation finds its way through the
cell or across the synapse, and then the gradual rise of resistance and
its conduction into new channels by fatigue of the synapse, or exhaustion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
of the cell and a consequent turning of the excitation through fresh
cells across fresh synapses before its passage into the efferent nerves.</p>

<p>When a light stimulation falls upon the retina, during the first one
hundredth or one fiftieth of a second the nervous excitation of neurin
will spread about generally through the retina for a considerable
distance from the point immediately excited. Thus by means of the
fibres of the retina faint excitations will go to the brain from all these
different points, so that one will perceive a faint cloud of light, similar
to that described under the first kind of irradiation. Moreover, since
the portion of the retina directly stimulated by the light will have the
most intense stimulation, this part will come to consciousness somewhat
more quickly than the outlying parts, so that the cloud of light
will first seem to spread outward from its source, and then, as the
resistance in the synapses is lowered through the more intense stimulation
of the part of the retina upon which the light directly falls, the
outrunning excitation will be "drained off" from these portions of the
retina outside of the borders of the image, and the halo or cloud of
light will appear to contract again. This was observed by Charpentier
and Bidwell, and in our own experiments.</p>

<p>Moreover, in case the synapses corresponding to the portions of the
retina indirectly stimulated should have themselves periods of discharge
and periods of charging, we might expect to see dark rings
upon this halo, this was also first observed by Charpentier and Bidwell.</p>

<p>Secondly, as the resistance is lowered in the central organs corresponding
to the end organs of the retina upon which the stimulation
falls, the image tends to assume its true form, but irradiation has been,
and probably still is, present through the layers of the retina, so that
certain favorably located portions of the image secure reÃ«nforcement by
means of this irradiation, in the manner described, and these portions
appear in consciousness sooner than the others. This reÃ«nforcement,
in the case of the travelling oblong image, will make it appear convex.
Moreover, since the resistance of the synapses corresponding to the
centre of the oblong images will be less than those corresponding to the
ends, there will be a certain tendency to "drain off" the stimulation
from the rest of the image, a sort of reÃ«nforcement of the reÃ«nforcement,
which will also help in making the image appear curved. Of
course all the conditions which we found to modify the curvature of
the images will still hold good, these conceptions being used only to
describe the course of events which causes the image to appear convex.
Thus a very weak or a very intense or a very long or an excessively
short image will not appear curved, owing to a lack of difference in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
intensity between the ends and the centre great enough to produce
perceptible curvature.</p>

<p>As to the third kind of irradiation, that which proceeds from the
ends of the moving image over the unstimulated portions of the retina,
and which has the appearance of long streamers of light extending outward
and backward from the moving image, this may be regarded as
being in certain respects a form of the first and very rapid kind of
excitation. It may well be that all the outrunning excitation which
occurs immediately upon stimulation does not find its way to the
central organs through those nerve-paths which correspond to the
directly stimulated portions of the retina, even after the form of the
image may be very clearly determined, but that some excitation proceeds
outward from one retinal element to another, arousing fainter
and fainter excitation as it proceeds. This being the case, we should
expect to find these streamers of light from the ends of the image
extending outward and backward over the retina. Of course the
faster the image moved and the more intense it was, the longer then
would be these streamers. For if the image moved very fast, very
much less of the excitation would be "drained off" through the
directly stimulated portion, and thus more of the excitation would be
left behind, so to speak, by the image when it moved along rapidly,
and this would appear to drag farther and farther behind. Of course
these streamers being curved backward would appear more curved
the faster the image moved, and if the pulsative processes occurred
with these stimulations which occur in the course of other retinal
stimulations, we should have Charpentier's "palm-branch" phenomenon.</p>

<p>The fourth kind of irradiation which we have defined is of course
the best-known form, and is that which has been the most discussed
by the many writers on the subject. It will be remembered that this
form appears in stationary objects which have been observed for some
little time (from four to ten seconds), and consists in the apparent
enlargement of a more intensely illuminated portion at the expense
of a less illuminated one. This enlargement occurs after all trace of
the first kind of irradiation has vanished, and of course no trace of the
third kind comes in, since the object is stationary. The course of
events may then be somewhat as follows. In the first perception of the
object we have the wide-spreading irradiation described. Then way
is made through the synapses corresponding to the stimulated portion
of the retina, and the wide-spreading irradiation is drained off through
these open channels, so that the image contracts again to its proper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
size. But at the same time it is not likely that there will not be a slight
irradiatory enlargement of the borders of the image. For irradiation is
present within the confines of the image. This is shown not only in
the case of moving images, but also in the fact that the edges of the
less intensely illuminated portions of the field are curved inward, this
being most probably due to the fact that the centres of the contiguous
luminous portions are reÃ«nforced by irradiation proceeding from the
direction of both the ends.</p>

<p>Not all of the excitation proceeds to the brain from the directly
stimulated portions of the image merely, but a little irradiates over
the borders and causes an apparent enlargement of the brighter field.
It has also been shown by Plateau and others that the amount of
irradiation increases both with the intensity of the stimulation and
with the time during which it acts. Of course, as to the intensity there
is no question. As to the time-element, it may be that the excitation at
the border spreads rather slowly outward after the previous contraction
of the image to its proper dimensions, which takes place within
a very short time after stimulation, until a sort of balance is reached
between the tendency of the image to enlarge itself through irradiation
and the tendency for this irradiatory excitation to be drained off
through the nerves corresponding to the stimulated portion of the
retina, after which no further apparent enlargement takes place.</p>

<p>In some of our experiments with dots we found that after a dot of
the proper intensity of illumination had been steadily gazed at for
some time the centre would appear dark. This seems to be due to the
fact that the centre of such an image was reÃ«nforced by irradiation, so
that the nervous mechanism corresponding to it became fatigued
more quickly and the stimulation at the centre no longer gave such
intense sensations as the rest of the figure, but appeared darker.</p>

<p>Passing to the fifth and last variety of irradiation, this seems due to
fatigue in the inhibiting apparatus which reduced the spread of the
first kind of irradiation. Following out the scheme we have applied, it
would seem as if the channels which were first opened by the direct
stimulation became blocked through fatigue, and, therefore, the excitation
produced in the retina were forced to seek new paths through to
the brain by means of the nerves which proceed from the unstimulated
portions of the retina. Thus if the resistance through fatigue occurs
slowly, the excitation which spreads may increase in intensity and in
extent. So, as the resistance increased, a portion corresponding to the
directly stimulated portion and its slight irradiatory enlargement of
the borders would be surrounded by a cloud of light growing in size
and intensity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course the limiting case would be when the external cloud of
light attained as great or even greater intensity as the stimulated
portion, but such a case would probably be impossible to realize
because of other conditions which would prevent.</p>

<p>It may be that this fifth variety is caused partly at least by a cortical
spreading of the excitation. But it seems to me more likely, in view of
the fact that we could find no irradiatory enlargement of the binocular
portions of stereoscopic images and for a number of other reasons,
that the induction is retinal in character and that after the resistance
through fatigue has arisen in the central organs the stimulation spreads
out over the retina to the unstimulated portions of the field and proceeds
from thence to the brain. This seems more probable than that
the stimulation continues to be confined merely to the stimulated
portion of the retina, but seeks passage from one portion to another
of the brain through fresh neurones which branch only from those
nerve-tracts which proceed from the directly stimulated portions of
the retina.</p>

<p>To conclude; we have seen that there are various forms of irradiation
which take place during the perception of stationary and moving
sources of illumination.</p>

<p>That there are certain modifications in the form of a moving image
which are probably due to one of these processes.</p>

<p>Concerning color irradiation it was found that the curvature of the
images varied with the color of the light, so that a figure illuminated
by a colored light of one intensity would not have the same curvature
as one illuminated by a light of the same intensity but of another color.
Green gives the greatest curvature, yellow the next, red and blue about
the same. In other words the differences in curvature of the images
follow the order of the brightness of the colors in a spectrum the intensity
of which is much reduced.</p>

<p>From a consideration of these phenomena we were led to discuss
the functions of the rods and cones in the retina of the eye, and the
suggestion was made that differences in color-vision were due to
central rather than retinal processes, and that in many cases of partial
or total color-blindness the retina would be found normal and the
defect in vision due to a lesion in some more central structure.</p>

<p>The various forms of visual irradiation which have been described
by a number of different writers we found to be all forms of one rather
simple process. Resistance, removal of resistance upon further stimulation,
and recurrence of resistance through fatigue in some part of the
optic tract, together with the spreading of stimulation over the retina<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
(probably through the molecular layers) from one afferent nerve to
another are assumed as the minimal requirements which are sufficient
to explain the five forms of irradiation which have been considered in
this paper.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_EXPRESSION_OF_FEELINGS" id="THE_EXPRESSION_OF_FEELINGS"></a>THE EXPRESSION OF FEELINGS</h2>

<p class="p6">BY F. M. URBAN</p>


<p>The material of this paper was obtained by an experimental investigation
which was carried on in the Harvard laboratory from February,
1904, till June, 1905. The immediate purpose of these experiments
was a study in the expression of the feeling-tone of simple sense-stimuli.
Breathing and circulation were the functions the changes of
which were observed by tracing the curves of thoracal and of abdominal
breathing and the sphygmographic curves simultaneously.
Acoustical, tactual, pain, and smell sensations were studied in this
way, special attention being devoted to the smell and pain sensations.
These stimuli have the advantage that the physiological reactions of
the subject are more uniform than the reactions to other stimuli. The
number of experiments performed in this investigation was large,
although a subject was never experimented on for more than forty
minutes, because the facilities of the laboratory allowed a continuous
experimenting for several hours a day on different subjects. All the
experiments were performed on trained subjects. Only the changes
in the form of the sphygmographic curve will be discussed in this
paper. The results of this observation confirm the observations of previous
investigators in so far as the same changes in the curves were
observed and the introspections of the subject were, on the whole,
similar to those obtained by other observers. It does not seem probable,
however, that a satisfactory discussion of the results can be given
on the basis of merely mechanical measurements of the curves, and it,
therefore, seemed necessary to reconsider the principles of the theory
of the sphygmographic curves.</p>

<p>There are two methods which can be applied to the study of the
psychology of feelings. They are called the method of impression and
the method of expression. The first is a purely psychological method,
while the latter is confined by its definition to the study of the physiological
changes which are the accompaniments of feelings. The
method of expression is never used as a pure method in investigations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
which are carried on for psychological purposes, because the introspections
of the subject must be compared with the physiological
results. It therefore has the character of a mixed method. The first
experimental investigations into the psychology of feelings were
started by Fechner, who employed the pure method of impression.
At this time, however, the apparatus for studying the circulation had
been greatly improved and sooner or later these instruments were sure
to be used for a more exact study of the influence of feelings on circulation.
It was to be hoped that the crude observations on the changes
of the heart-beats and of the circulation under the influence of feelings
might be followed up in detail.</p>

<p>Darwin laid stress on the importance of certain bodily accompaniments
of feelings, and he inaugurated the genetic explanation in this
field. But even if the genetic explanation is successfully carried
through, human psychology remains unexplained, and, furthermore,
those emotional expressions which Darwin described form only a part
of the physiological accompaniments which may be observed with
the instruments now in use. The invention or at least the great improvement
of these instruments is due to the investigators in the
middle of the last century, and a more thorough understanding of the
delicate changes of respiration, circulation, and of temperature was not
possible before the construction of these sensitive recorders. It seems
that Mosso was the first to observe these small changes under the
influence of mental activity in general, and feelings in special; in this
sense it may be said that Mosso started the experimental physiology
of feelings. The discovery of the influence of feelings on circulation is
very important, and it is to be appreciated that Mosso saw these slight
changes which escaped an observer like Marey. In the MÃ©moire offered
to the Academy<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> on March 26, 1860, Marey gives a great number of
circumstances which influence the sphygmographic curve, but feelings
or mental phenomena are not mentioned in this list. It is true that he
speaks in a later publication<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> of the influence of "moral ideas" on the
circulation and makes the hypothesis that these ideas influence the
circulation in the same way as other disturbing influences, <em>i. e.</em>, by
changing the peripheral resistance. At this time Marey was already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
in possession of his sphygmograph, but nothing in this passage indicates
that he saw the influence of feelings on the tracings. On the
contrary, the words "Sans rien livrer Ã  l'hypothÃ¨se" seem to indicate
that Marey had no other facts in mind than those commonly known.
He certainly did not follow up his observation, and his statement at
this point does not differ very much from the observations of the old
psychologists, that emotions change certain physiological functions,
of which a more or less complete list is frequently given.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>It certainly is a long step from this vague statement to Mosso's experimental
investigations. His new instruments, the plethysmograph,
and the balance, enabled him to study the distribution of the blood,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
and he observed the influence of mental phenomena on the circulation,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
on the bladder,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> and on the temperature of the brain.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> His
work, "La Paura," describes the physiological effects of emotions
somewhat in detail.</p>

<p>The way toward applying the method of expression to the study of
emotions was shown by the results of previous physiological investigations.
Casual observations of the influence of certain sense-stimuli on
respiration and circulation were made by Naumann, Couty and
Charpentier, Thanhoffer, Dogiel, Gley, Mays, Istomanow and
Tarchanoff, FÃ©rÃ©, Delabarre, and others.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> The changes of breathing
seem to be of greater importance, and some writers account breathing
the most delicate physiological index of feelings.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> It seems, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
that a satisfactory treatment can be obtained only by direct comparison
of the respiration and circulation, and it now but seldom occurs
that circulation is observed exclusively.</p>

<p>There are three different instruments for observing the circulation:
the plethysmograph, the sphygmomanometer, and the sphygmograph.
Each of these instruments allows one to observe a different feature of
the circulation. The sphygmomanometer records the pressure in the
artery; the plethysmograph records the volume of a certain part of
the body; and the sphygmograph records the movement of a certain
part of the arterial wall. The curves traced with the sphygmograph
indicate to a certain extent the pressure of the blood, and sometimes
they are called curves of blood-pressure to distinguish them from the
plethysmographic curves which are called curves of pulse-volume.</p>

<p>The invention of these instruments is due to physiological investigations
of the pulse. The problem of studying the pulse by graphic, or
at least experimental methods, begins with the investigations of Hales
and Poiseuille. The first great success in this line was the construction
of the "Kymographion" of Ludwig, but this instrument had the disadvantage
that it could be applied only by scission of an artery. This
circumstance, of course, confined the application of the instrument to
the study of the pulse of animals. After several attempts by HÃ©risson,
Chelius, and others, Vierordt succeeded in constructing his sphygmograph,
by which curves of the normal human pulse could be obtained.
Some years afterwards Marey constructed his much more sensitive
instrument, which was made still handier by the use of air transmission.
Buisson was the first to use air transmission for sphygmography,
but Upham had used it before for similar purposes. A considerable
number of sphygmographs has been constructed since, and though
they may show some improvements in detail, the technique of the
sphygmograph has made no marked progress since Marey, and his
instrument has been found by experimental tests remarkably exact.</p>

<p>The curves traced with the sphygmograph are extremely variable
in shape and size. In almost every normal curve, however, a steep
ascent may be seen; it is called the up-stroke or percussion stroke,
and this part of the sphygmographic curve has the name of the anacrotic
phase. This line of ascent ends abruptly and within the limits
of the usual speed of the recording drum it goes over into the descent
by a sharp angle. The descending part of the curve is called the
catacrotic phase. The descent is not so abrupt and is not a more or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
less straight line, but is interrupted by secondary elevations. The first
secondary elevation is the largest and is called the dicrotic.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>These secondary elevations were seen first by Chelius and Vierordt,
and from the beginning they aroused considerable interest. It was
known that sometimes during fever the pulse takes an abnormal
form, where two beats of the pulse, a strong one and a weaker one,
may be felt for every heart-beat (pulsus bis feriens). This form of the
pulse was thought to be entirely abnormal and it was therefore a great
surprise for the first modern investigators to find these secondary
elevations in tracings of the normal pulse curve. The conviction of
the abnormality of the dicrotic pulse form was so firm that Vierordt
always applied his instrument in such a way that it did not trace the
dicrotic elevation, although it was sensitive enough to trace the exact
form of the pulse curve. Marey, however, used his much more delicate
instrument and found the dicrotic elevation in most of the normal
pulse curves.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> For this reason Marey's sphygmograph met at first
with considerable criticism (Meissner), but the critical examinations
by v. Wittich, Buisson, and Mach showed that the dicrotic elevation
could not be due to an error of the instrument, for so great an error
was out of question, and there no longer remained a doubt as to the
genuine existence of the dicrotic elevation in the normal pulse curve.
The sphygmograph, thus, had revealed two new and surprising features
of the pulse; (1) The ascent and the descent do not take place
with equal rapidity, the ascent being steep, the descent gradual;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>(2) the descent is interrupted by secondary elevations. Neither of
these facts could be observed by applying the finger and it seemed
important to explain them. The explanation of the dicrotic promised
to be of special interest, as it was shown that abnormal dicrotism is
in close relation to the normal form of the pulse curve.</p>

<p>This caused considerable interest in the observation of the pulse,
and the sphygmograph was supposed to be of the greatest importance
for medical diagnosis. Burdon Sanderson,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Landois, Lorain,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Ozanam,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
Pfungen,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Riegel,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Roy and Adami,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> and others have studied
the sphygmographic curve under abnormal conditions, and wellnigh
all diseases have been studied by these observers with the sphygmograph.
The results were ambiguous and did not seem to justify the
amount of work spent on these observations. The enthusiasm for
the sphygmograph subsided, and it was no longer expected to obtain
a diagnosis, or even, indeed, a prognosis of a disease from mere inspection
of a pulse curve. Later investigators, in fact, confined their
research to the proof of the ambiguity of the sphygmograms, which
could be valuable only in connection with other observations. It could
not be hoped that an explanation of the abnormalities of the pulse
curve would be found before an understanding of the normal form
was attained. It, therefore, seemed necessary to decide between two
theories of the origin of the normal pulse curve, which had opposed
each other almost since the discovery of the existence of the dicrotic
elevation. Both theories chiefly refer to the origin of the dicrotic,
and they agree on this, that the dicrotic elevation is due to a wave
travelling in the blood, but they disagree on the direction in which this
wave is moving. These two theories may be called the theory of the
peripheral, and the theory of the central origin of the dicrotic wave.</p>

<p>The theory of the peripheral origin of the dicrotic wave assumes
that the change of pressure which is indicated by the dicrotic elevation
originates somewhere at the periphery and travels through the
arteries towards the heart.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Commonly it is assumed that the dicrotic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
originates in the arterioles. This theory has been mentioned first,
because it is the simpler in every respect, though the less probable.
The origin of the dicrotic wave according to this theory is similar to
the origin of the echo.</p>

<p>Buisson was the first who gave an explanation of the dicrotic elevation
by assuming a central origin of this wave. His theory was adopted
by Marey, who stated it in this way. The action of the heart causes the
blood to be pumped into the aorta with considerable strength. The
blood leaves the aorta by its inertia and expands the arterial system.
In the arterioles it finds an obstacle and being reflected it flows back
to the aorta. But there it finds the semilunar valves closed and a new
wave is produced by reflection. This wave has an effect similar to the
first, and this reflection of waves lasts until the valves are thrown
open again. The existence of several secondary waves is explained by
the great velocity with which the blood travels through the arterial
system.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>This theory is open to many objections. First, there is no reason
why the blood wave should not produce a dicrotic elevation when it
flows back to the aorta. Second, the narrow lumen of the arterioles
cannot be an obstacle to the flowing blood, because if an artery
splits up into small branches, the sum of the lumina of the branches is
greater than the lumen of the artery. Lack of space, therefore, cannot
be the cause of the reflection of the pulse wave. Marey, finally, is
mistaken in his conception of the effect of the blood pumped into the
aorta by the action of the left ventricle. He supposes that the entering
blood pushes before it the whole column of blood in the arteries.
This view is refuted by the actual measurements of the velocity of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
pulse wave, because if it were true the pulse would appear at the same
moment in every part of the body.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>These are the more obvious of the arguments against Marey's
theory. Other investigators have tried to state a more correct theory
of the central origin of the dicrotic wave. Landois's theory belongs to
this type of improved theories of the central origin. The action of the
left ventricle, according to Landois, causes the primary pulse wave
which travels down the arterial system, until it is extinguished in the
arterioles. The walls of the arteries are expanded by the arriving
blood wave, and, when the valves close, they force the blood onward
by their elasticity. There is a free way to the periphery, but the blood
pushed towards the heart finds the semilunar valves closed and is
reflected. In this way a new positive wave originates which may produce
in the same way a secondary or tertiary wave.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>It seemed necessary first to decide between the theories of the
central and of the peripheral origin of the dicrotic wave. Many
investigations have been carried on for this purpose, and some of them
bear witness to the high ability of the investigators. It is, however,
remarkable that the arguments which have been brought forward
in favor of one hypothesis chiefly consist in reasons why the other
hypothesis should not be accepted. These experiments can be
divided into two classes. The first class comprises all the experiments
which study the relation of the pulse curve to other functions, or its
dependence on various conditions. The above mentioned observations
of the pathological changes of the pulse curve belong to this
class. The object of frequent studies of this type has been the
relation of the sphygmographic curve to the curve of the apex beat.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>Maurer,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Gibson,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> FranÃ§ois Frank,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> and Edgren<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> deal with this
problem. The curve of intraventricular pressure cannot be studied
in man for obvious reasons, and only in some cases has an attempt
been made to compare the sphygmographic curve with the curve of
intraventricular pressure obtained from animals. One of the most
interesting attempts in this line will be mentioned later.</p>

<p>To the second class belong all those investigations, by which experimental
evidence in favor of one or the other hypothesis has been
collected. The experiments which belong to this class are in so far
more decisive as the conditions of the experiments are better known
and, therefore, easier to interpret. Von Kries proved the existence of
the dicrotic in the femoral artery of an animal after having replaced
the heart by a bag filled with liquid.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> Grashey<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> and Hoorweg<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> have
demonstrated the existence of secondary waves in models, on which
peripheral reflection was impossible. To the same type of experiments
belong Marey's<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> and Grashey's registration of the waves in elastic
tubes, and Mach's<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> tracings from a mechanical model on which the
resulting movement of two simple components could be registered.
Without giving any physiological theory Mach showed how curves
similar to the pulse curves can be obtained by the registration of a
movement, the mechanical conditions of which are known.</p>

<p>As the results of these investigations, we may state the following
facts as arguments against any hypothesis of the peripheral origin
of the dicrotic elevation.</p>

<p>(1) Automatic registration of the pulse wave shows that the dicrotic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
appears sooner in the regions nearer to the heart than in regions which
are more distant. The opposite would be the case if the dicrotic
elevation were due to a wave travelling from the periphery to the
heart.</p>

<p>(2) The dicrotic appears at the same time after the primary wave
in a dwarf as in a tall man. This would be impossible if the wave
had to travel so much farther.</p>

<p>(3) Inhalation of amyl nitrite makes the dicrotic almost disappear.
The adherents of the theory of the peripheral origin of the dicrotic
wave explain this fact by supposing that this drug dilates the arterioles
and makes little reflection possible. Their opponents say that the
action of the heart and the resistance of the system are so enfeebled
that the backward flow is slight and gives rise only to a small wave.</p>

<p>(4) If an artery is opened and the blood allowed to spurt on a
revolving drum of white paper a curve is obtained which shows the
dicrotic elevation (the hemautographic curve of Landois). The
resistance of the periphery is totally lacking in this case and the
dicrotic elevation could not appear if it were due to a wave reflected
at the periphery.</p>

<p>(5) The appearance of the dicrotic is not retarded if an elastic
tube is placed between the periphery and the place where the instrument
is adjusted. If the dicrotic were due to a wave reflected at the
periphery it would be retarded because the wave would have to travel
a distance so much greater.</p>

<p>These arguments prove the impossibility of the theory of the peripheral
origin of the dicrotic wave. Also the other hypothesis meets
with a number of serious difficulties, and we mention the following
facts which are arguments not against any special form of this theory,
but against any hypothesis which starts from the assumption that the
dicrotic elevation is due to a wave travelling from the heart to the
periphery.</p>

<p>(1) The descent of the catacrotic phase ought to be a succession
of diminishing waves, but not a slow descent with merely small
elevations.</p>

<p>(2) This hypothesis accounts for none of the abnormal pulse forms.</p>

<p>(3) The blood ought to push against the semilunar valves with a
force not less than 1/2 - 2/3 of the force of the contraction of the ventricle,
because this is about the relative height of the first secondary elevation
with regard to the primary wave, which is due to the contraction
of the ventricle.</p>

<p>(4) It does not account for the disappearance of the dicrotic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
elevation through lack of elasticity of the arterial wall: for the dicrotic
elevation is most marked in youth, becomes lower in old age,
and disappears in diseases like atheroma and arteriosclerosis, which
impair the elasticity of the arterial wall. Landois's theory overcomes
this theory only apparently, although the dicrotic would be absent,
yet in that case the descent of the primary wave ought to be as steep
as its ascent.</p>

<p>(5) This theory is refuted by the experiment of v. Kries, who
proved the existence of the dicrotic if the heart is replaced by a
valveless bag.</p>

<p>The obvious impossibility of making the theories agree with the
facts does not permit one to accept any of them. All of them are
based on the supposition that the dicrotic elevation is due to a wave
travelling in the blood, and this belief is founded on the following
argument: If a wave travels in the blood the sphygmographic curve
shows an elevation; the dicrotic elevation is an elevation in the
sphygmographic curve. Therefore, the dicrotic elevation is due to a
wave travelling in the blood. This fallacy is responsible for the astonishing
fact that the refutation of one of two apparently contradictory
statements does not prove the other. It is characteristic of the present
state of the problem concerning the origin of the dicrotic elevation,
that a modern writer<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> calls it "inextricably complicated."</p>

<p>The contradiction between the theories of the peripheral and of the
central origin of the dicrotic, however, is only apparent, and neither
may be true, because it might be that this elevation is not due to a
wave which travels in the blood. The experiments of the previous
investigators seem to point in this direction. The disappearance of
the secondary elevations when the arterial wall has lost the properties
of an elastic body, the above-mentioned experiments of v. Kries, and
the observations of Grashey and Marey on the movements of the walls
of an elastic tube indicate clearly that nothing but elasticity is needed
to produce these secondary or dicrotic elevations, for, in the different
experiments, they are produced as well when the heart and its valves
are replaced by a valveless bag as when the function of the valves is
unimpaired; as well with resistance at the periphery as without, the
only condition being that the walls are elastic. This proves the importance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
of the elasticity of the arterial wall. The experiments of the
graphic registration of the movements of the walls of an elastic tube,
furthermore, indicate that the conditions of this experiment are a
close imitation of the mechanical conditions which prevail in the
arteries. It may be expected that the analysis of the conditions of
the experiment will give an insight into the origin of the sphygmographic
curves, because the tracings which Grashey and Marey took
from the walls of a rubber tube resemble closely the tracings of the
human pulse. This experiment, first, proves that the form of the curve
depends merely on physical conditions. The movement of a point of
the wall of the tube depends on the following four factors: (1) The
elasticity of the wall; (2) the incompressibility of the liquid; (3) the
form of the original wave, <em>i. e.</em>, the way in which the liquid is pumped
into the tube; (4) the rate of outflow. If the process of pressing liquid
into the tube is repeated regularly, a stationary form of movement will
be obtained eventually; the amount of outflow for one interval is
constant in this case. This means that eventually a state is attained
where the same quantity of liquid which is pumped into the tube at
one end flows out from the tube at the other. The physiological bearing
of this result is that the turgor of an artery does not change without
a cause. Such a change would be indicated by the going up or
down of the base-line of the tracing.</p>

<p>The first two factors are, in physiology, studied with relative ease.
The elastic qualities of the arteries have been studied since Poiseuille
and John Hunter by Wertheim, Zwardemaaker, Marey, and others,
and they are more or less well known. The physical properties of the
blood are very nearly those of an incompressible liquid, and this is
certainly true for the small pressure to which the blood is exposed
in the arteries.</p>

<p>As to the initial form of the wave which the action of the left ventricle
produces in the arterial system, we get a hint from the experiments
of Grashey, v. Kries, and Marey, where the sudden compression
of a bag furnished the initial shock.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> These changes of pressure
can be represented by a curve like that in Fig. 1.</p>

<p>So long as the contraction of the left ventricle lasts and the valves
are open, the action of the heart produces a certain pressure in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
the aorta, but the influence of the intraventricular pressure is zero
when the valves are closed.
The second phase of the
curve Fig. 1, where the
pressure is zero, certainly
gives the influence of the
intraventricular pressure
during the diastole, because
there is no communication
between the ventricle and
the arterial system when
the valves are closed. The
question is whether the
rest of the curve can represent the changes of the intraventricular
pressure when the valves are open.</p>

</div>

<p>The first curves of intraventricular pressure were traced by Chauveau
and Marey. These experiments were made on a horse, and they
have been repeated since it was discovered that they can be performed
also on smaller animals. Besides Chauveau and Marey may be
mentioned the names of Fick, Huerthle, v. Frey, Rolleston, Bayliss
and Starling. The curves obtained by various observers belong to
two types; one shows the so called "plateau," the other does not.
Recent experiments have proved that this difference of results is due
to a difference in methods. This also is suggested by the fact that different
curves have been obtained from animals of the same species.
Two methods have been applied lately for testing these curves of intraventricular
pressure. The first was devised by Bayliss and Starling.
It consisted chiefly in the photographic registration of the movement
of the liquid in a manometer tube. The photographic registration is
frictionless, and the mass of the moving liquid was so small that
vibrations by inertia were fairly excluded for pressures which are not
greater than the intraventricular pressure.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> The second method was
used by Porter. The idea of this method was to trace only a part of
the curve, not the whole. The writing lever, thus, has in the beginning
of the tracing no inertia at all, and the tracing may be overdrawn
but is certainly correct in form up to the next point of inflexion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
curve.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> These tests and the repeated experiments of Chauveau leave
no doubt as to the existence of the plateau.</p>

<p>The varying pressure from the heart which produces the pulse wave
may be described in this way: The pressure suddenly rises to a maximum
and maintains it for a certain time; when the semilunar valves
close, the pressure drops as suddenly as it rose, and remains at zero
until the valves open again. Such a function can be represented by a
curve like Fig. 1, and this is the reason why the complicated action of
the heart can be superseded by the compression of a bag without
changing the mechanical conditions of the problem. Of course it can
not be expected that a schematic curve will show all the details of the
real tracing. It is suggested, however, by Frank<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> that many of the
small irregularities of the curve of intraventricular pressure are due
to vibrations caused by the inertia of the apparatus and that the true
form of the curve of intraventricular pressure is very simple. This
remark is supported by Huerthle,<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> who tested the apparatus of Marey,
Knoll and Grunmach. Marey's tambour was found to be the most
exact, but even this instrument produces deformities in the tracings,
though the general outlines are exact. This would indicate that the
schematic representation of Fig. 1 is a very close imitation of the real
form of the curve of intraventricular pressure, although empirical
tracings do not show right angles and straight lines. It seems, however,
that the undulations of the plateau are genuine, since they are found
in the most reliable tracings, and it may be possible to explain them
merely on the basis of the physical conditions of the experiment.</p>

<p>The fourth factor of importance is the rate of outflow. We may
introduce the following assumption as to the rate of outflow of the
blood through the capillaries: The outflow through the capillaries
is uniform in the short time of one heart-beat. The fact has been
mentioned above that the quantity of outflowing blood must be equal
to the quantity of incoming, for any stationary form of the pulse
movement; this new hypothesis means that the velocity of the outflow
is constant. One might think that this assumption is warranted
by the law of Poiseuille that the amount of outflow through a horizontal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
capillary filled with liquid under constant pressure depends
on the fourth power of the radius and on the difference of pressure
at the two ends of the tube, and is inversely proportional to the constant
of friction and to the length of the tube. This law has been
proved mathematically and tested physically only for horizontal
tubes and constant pressure. Neither of these suppositions holds for
the capillaries of the arterial system. The connection between the
hypothesis in question and Poiseuille's law is this. Let us suppose
that an artery splits up in a great number of arterioles which go off
in every direction. The amount of outflow is then a complicated
function, because the law of Poiseuille does not hold for every direction
of the capillaries; but it will be equal to the outflow through
a tube of certain radius and certain direction in the same time. Our
assumption says that the law of Poiseuille holds for this typical but
imaginary tube. The essential point of this hypothesis is merely the
supposition that the outflow of blood through the capillaries follows
&#945; law.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>It is possible to show that the graphic registration of a movement
under these four conditions must give curves which correspond to the
pulse curves in every respect. The action of the left ventricle causes
the pulse wave which travels through the arterial system with considerable
velocity. This wave expands the arteries and the whole
system is filled with blood because the wave arrives by its great velocity
at the periphery before the contraction of the ventricle is finished.
The increased pressure forces the blood to enter the arterioles, through
which it passes at a constant rate. When the valves are closed, the
amount of blood decreases uniformly and the volume of the blood
contained in an artery can be represented graphically by a straight
line of more or less steep descent, as is shown in Fig. 2. Now the walls
of an artery have to a high degree the qualities of an elastic body, and,
therefore, they are forced back by elasticity after being displaced
from the position of equilibrium by the shock of the arriving pulse
wave. The movement of a point of the arterial wall, therefore, results
from two components: (1) From the movement which it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
perform if it were merely forced to remain on the surface of the
blood in the artery, and (2) from the movement due to the elasticity
of the arterial wall. Both movements have the same direction, because
the column of blood is enclosed in a cylinder the radius of which
decreases regularly, and the elastic force of the arterial wall is directed
towards the centre. The direction of both forces is in the line of the
radius, and the resulting movement of these two components, therefore,
can be found by simple superposition. Of the first component
we know that it can be represented graphically by a straight line.</p>

<p>An elastic force tends always to bring the body back to the position
of equilibrium; if the distance is not too great, the force is proportional
to the elongation. A physical body is always under the
influence of friction, the acceleration of which is opposite to the direction
of the movement, and therefore diminishes the velocity. The
form of the resulting movement depends on the amount of friction,
and, roughly speaking, we may distinguish two types of elastic movements:<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
the first type is a periodic movement, the second an aperiodic.
Let us suppose that a body is carried from its position of equilibrium
by a sudden impulse, which transmits a certain velocity to the body.
Friction and elasticity diminish this velocity, and after a certain time
the body attains a maximum elongation, where the velocity is zero.
Then the body returns under the influence of elasticity and under the
retardation of friction. There are two cases possible, either the elastic
force is strong enough to overcome friction and to carry the body
over the position of equilibrium, or it is not strong enough. In the
first case, it is easy to see, the body repeats the same form of movement
on the other side of the position of equilibrium, and the conditions
being constant a vibratory movement results as the stationary
form. In the second case the body approaches the position of equilibrium
asymptotically. The first case may be illustrated by the vibrations
of a magnet needle suspended with little friction, the second
by the movement of a door which is regulated by a well-working
shutter.</p>

<p>These forms of the movement of a body under the influence of
elasticity and friction are illustrated in Fig. 3.</p>

<p>Curve 1 shows a movement where friction is so small that it can be
neglected; it is, of course, a simple sine curve. Curve 2 shows the effect
of friction on vibrations. The period of damped vibrations is greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
than in the frictionless movement, but the amplitudes are smaller.
The amplitudes of a damped vibration decrease constantly and there is
a simple relation between two subsequent amplitudes. The ratio between
them is constant, and, therefore, if one amplitude and this constant
ratio are known, all the other amplitudes can be calculated. The
amplitudes of such a movement decrease as the terms of a geometric
series. The dotted line in Fig. 4 represents the rapidity of this decrease.
It is obvious that the smaller the constant ratio of two subsequent
terms is, the more rapidly will the amplitudes decrease. This ratio
depends on friction, and becomes smaller when friction becomes
greater. A vibration under heavy friction dies out quickly. Curve 3
shows a movement where friction is too great to allow any vibrations.
The body does not acquire a velocity which can carry it over the position
of equilibrium, but it approaches this position with ever diminishing
velocity.</p>

</div>

<p>These are the types of movement which the arterial wall can perform<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
by its elasticity in consequence of the shock of the arriving pulse
wave. The mechanical nature of the components on which depends
the form of the sphygmographic curve is, therefore, known. The constructions
in Fig. 5 show how the resulting movement can be found.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img  src="images/img017.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="caption">Fig. 5</p></div>
</div>

<p>These curves are constructed in this way. The lines <em>AB</em> represent
the time of the interval of one heart-beat. The straight line <em>EB</em>
represents the decreasing volume of the artery and the curves on <em>AB</em>
represent the elastic movement of the arterial wall. Both are synchronous
movements, and a line perpendicular to <em>AB</em> gives the corresponding
points. The points of the resulting movement are found
by arithmetical addition of the two ordinates. The results of these
constructions prove that the curves show the dicrotic elevation only
if the elastic force is great enough to make a vibratory movement
possible. Aperiodic movements do not produce this elevation. The
friction is always great for the movement of the walls of an artery,
and there are only the two possibilities, of a vibratory movement
which dies out quickly, and of an aperiodic movement. This accounts
for the fact that the dicrotic elevation may be missing sometimes,
and that in other cases several secondary elevations may be seen, the
number of which, however, is always limited, and their relative height
rapidly diminishing. It may be remarked that the length of the lines
<em>AB</em> seems essential to the form of the resulting curve. Curves I and III
differ very much in the length of the lines <em>AB</em>, while the lines <em>AE</em> are
equal and the vibratory movements are only slightly different. The
resultants, nevertheless, seem to differ very much. It is easy to see
that a different speed of the recording drum will have an effect on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
tracings which is similar to that of a change in the length of the lines
<em>AB</em> in the constructions. This is one more reason why mere inspection
of the curves cannot give a satisfactory result.</p>

<p>These constructions show that the sphygmographic curves must
show great variations, since the amount of blood pumped into the
system, the elasticity of the arteries and friction of the surrounding
tissues are subjected very likely not only to individual but also to local
and temporal variations. But under given conditions only a certain
form of the pulse wave is possible, and this form does not change so
long as these conditions do not change. The sphygmograms in Fig. 6
show some of the typical forms of the pulse curve.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img  src="images/img018.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="caption">Fig. 6</p></div>
</div>

<p>No. I shows the influence of high arterial tension, and No. II of
low tension. The first corresponds to No. II in Fig. 5, the second
to Nos. I and III. Nos. IV and V of Fig. 5 show the effect of great
friction and small elasticity. The constructions differ in the form of
the elastic movement; the position of equilibrium is reached with
different velocity in both cases. The resulting movements differ slightly
in the form of the catacrotic phase. Both forms may be seen in No. III
of Fig. 6. This sphygmogram was taken from an artery with low tension,
and this form of the sphygmographic curve is well known as
characteristic of the "soft" pulse. If the artery has lost to a large
extent the qualities of an elastic body, and if the outflow is very rapid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
the pulse curve shows nothing but the slight elevation of the travelling
wave; No. IV in Fig. 6 shows a curve of this character.</p>

<p>This theory explains many surprising facts which resisted every
attempt at explanation. The anacrotic part shows a steep ascent,
because it is due to the sudden arrival of the blood wave. It seems that
an interruption in the descent may be seen only in abnormal cases.
The sphygmograms of twelve normal individuals were observed
regularly by me during more than a year without once discovering
an anacrotic elevation.</p>

<p>The hemautographic curve of Landois is produced in this way.
The form of this curve depends on the velocity of the escaping jet of
blood. The velocity of the blood flow depends on the resistance of
the arterial system in the sense that the velocity decreases when the
resistance increases. When the arterial wall is in the negative phase
of vibration the lumen of the artery is smaller, and, therefore, the
velocity smaller. This is confirmed by the actual tracings of the
velocity of the circulation by Marey.</p>

<p>It is also obvious that the dicrotic elevation never can arrive before
the primary wave, because the arterial wall cannot perform elastic
vibrations before it is expanded by the impulse of the arriving blood
wave. Neither is it surprising that the "dicrotic wave" seems to
travel in the same direction and with a velocity equal or almost equal
to the velocity of the pulse wave. Such a difference can be produced
only by a difference in the time of the vibrations of the arteries at
different points of the body. The time of one vibration is necessarily
very short, and the length of this interval depends on the circumstances
which determine the elasticity of the arterial wall and the friction.
These conditions may be subjected to local variations. If, therefore, the
time-interval between the primary and the secondary elevation is
measured at two different points (<em>e. g.</em>, at the carotid and at the radialis)
a difference of time may be found. Starting from the supposition that
the dicrotic elevation is due to a wave travelling in the blood, one
could attribute this difference of time to a velocity of the "dicrotic
wave" which is slightly different from the velocity of the primary
wave. The fact that the dicrotic elevation appears later in places
farther from the heart was interpreted as a proof that the wave
travelled out from the heart. No theory which assumes that the dicrotic
elevation is due to a wave travelling in the blood can give a reason why
two waves of the same form and origin should travel through the same
liquid at different velocities.</p>

<p>At this point a theory must be mentioned, which was brought forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
recently, because it is based on measurements of the velocity
of propagation of the dicrotic wave. This theory is connected with
Krehl's theory of the function of the valves. The blood, according
to Krehl, enters the aorta through a small opening, and expanding in
a large space it produces fluctuations and eddies, which would close
the valves if they were not kept open by the blood which streams
through under high pressure. They must, therefore, close at the moment
when the aortic pressure is equal to the intraventricular pressure.
This occurs shortly after the moment indicated by the beginning of the
decline of the intraventricular pressure curve. Now the second sound
of the heart is heard somewhere in the descending part of the cardiogram<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
and the measurements of Huerthle<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> have shown that the
second sound is heard 0.02" after the beginning of the descent of the
cardiogram. This seems to indicate that the second sound of the
heart is in a temporal relation to the closure of the valves. Many
theories of the origin of the sounds of the heart agree on this one
point that the second sound is due to a noise in the muscles. It
therefore may be supposed that the second sound is due to the tension
of the valves when they close or shortly afterwards. The problem
now would seem to be to find an elevation in the descending
branch of the curve of intraventricular pressure, or in the tracings of
the apex beat, which could be attributed to the closure of the valves.
It was taken for granted that the curves of intraventricular pressure
and those of the apex beat were identical. In many of these tracings
an elevation was found which may be called "the wave <em>f</em>." This elevation
is not found in all the tracings, and its position seems to be rather
variable. Edgren<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> remarks that the wave <em>f</em> was always found near the
abscissa no matter whether the preceding decline of the curve was
great or small. In some of Chauveau's tracings the wave <em>f</em> is missing
or indistinct,<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> in others it is very well marked and approximately in
the middle of the descending branch of the curve.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>Edgren made experiments on the temporal relation of the wave <em>f</em>
and of the dicrotic wave, which to avoid misunderstandings he calls
the "wave <em>f</em>Â´." His experiments were made as follows. A sphygmogram
from the carotid and a cardiogram were taken simultaneously,
the points of the writing-levers being in the same vertical line. The
wave <em>f</em>Â´ appeared a little after the wave <em>f</em>. The length of this interval
could be calculated by measuring the distance between these waves,
as the speed of the drum was known. From this was subtracted
the time of propagation of the dicrotic from the heart to the point where
the instrument was fixed. In this way it was found that the time between
the appearance of the wave <em>f</em> and of the wave <em>f</em>Â´ was equal to
the time of propagation of the dicrotic wave from the heart. Edgren
concluded that the dicrotic wave is in close temporal relation to the
closure of the valves.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> To this comes the supposition that the wave
<em>f</em>Â´ is due to a change of pressure proceeding from the heart. The
wave <em>f</em>Â´, therefore, could be attributed to the tension of the valves.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
Edgren and Tigerstedt are the chief exponents of this theory.</p>

<p>In so far as this theory assumes that the dicrotic elevation is due to
a wave travelling from the heart to the periphery,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> it is open to all the
arguments against a theory of the central origin of the dicrotic wave.
Against the more special assertion that the dicrotic elevation is in
connection with the closure of the valves, the following facts must
be mentioned. We grant that the tracings of the apex beat may be
directly substituted for the curves of intraventricular pressure, although
this is by no means obvious, since one tracing gives the form
of the pressure changes and the other the effect of the shock of the
heart against the wall of the chest. It is, furthermore, not proved
that the wave <em>f</em> is due to the closure of the valves and that the waves
<em>f</em> and <em>f</em>Â´ correspond to each other so closely as Edgren's experiments
seem to indicate. His measurements of the length of lines were made
with an exactitude of 0.1 mm., but his computations were carried to
the third decimal place of a second. The third decimal is generally
inexact and the second in a large number of cases. Experimental
evidence, furthermore, directly contradicts the statement that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
dicrotic elevation corresponds to the wave <em>f</em>. Fredericq<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> traced pressure
curves in the ventricle and in the aorta, and determined the
points of equal pressure in both curves. He thus found that a point
near the beginning of the descent of the curve of intraventricular
pressure corresponds to the dicrotic. His experiments are rather
conclusive against the theory in question, since the wave <em>f</em> is very well
marked in these tracings of Fredericq. The following facts, however,
are fatal for the theory that the closure of the valves causes the dicrotic
elevation: The dicrotic wave disappears in diseases like atheroma
and arteriosclerosis which do not impair the function of the
valves, but affect the elasticity of the arterial wall, and it is not affected
by valvular insufficiency. The independence of the dicrotic from the
function of the valves is conclusively proved by v. Kries, who found
the dicrotic elevation in the femoral artery of an animal whose heart
was replaced by a valveless bag.</p>

<p>All these facts, on the contrary, can be understood easily in the
light of the theory that the sphygmographic curve gives the movements
of the arterial wall, which movement is conditioned by the
decreasing amount of blood in the artery, and the elastic vibrations
of the wall around a variable position of equilibrium. In some cases
the conditions of the problem are rather simple, and admit an analytic
treatment, the results of which fit closely to the experimental facts.
This part of the theory, however, has merely physiological interest,
and therefore is discussed in a separate paper. It may be mentioned
at this point that this theory of normal dicrotism is essentially
identical with the theory of abnormal dicrotism as stated by Galen.
He believed that the second beat of the pulsus bis feriens was due to
an elastic vibration of the arterial wall. "Ex eodem genere sunt
dicroti; nam arteria in occursu quasi repellitur, moxque redit....
Neque enim tum arteria contrahitur, sed quasi concuteretur, occidit;
cuius delapsum a primae distentionis termino nulla dirimit manifesta
quies, ut animadvertitur in contractione: sed simulatque attolli
destitit, recidit atque ita paulisper vibrata, mox occurrit iterum."<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
Galen, however, is mistaken in his view, and in his observation that
sometimes three or more pulse-beats may be felt with the finger.
No form of the pulse is known where three or more beats may be felt
for every heart-beat, and the actual tracings exclude the possibility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
of this observation for the pulsus bis feriens. The pulsus bis feriens
is due to an increase of the frequency of the heart-beats. If
the new pulse wave arrives before the vibrations of the arterial wall
have had time to subside, the new wave and the already existing
vibration may interfere in such a way as to produce this abnormal
pulse form.</p>

<p>The form of a single wave of the sphygmographic curve may be
influenced by changes in the following conditions:</p>

<p>(1) The pulse wave may have an initial form which cannot be
represented by the schematic curve in Fig. 1. This may be due to an
irregularity of the function of the ventricle. The action of the heart
has an influence on the length of the waves, which length is determined
by the rapidity of the heart-beats. This influence has been
mentioned before. A change in the rapidity of the heart-beats has no
great influence on the form of the catacrotic part of the curve so long
as the impact of the new pulse wave does not arrive before the vibrations
of the arterial wall have had time to subside.</p>

<p>(2) Differences of the elasticity of the arterial wall affect materially
the form of the catacrotic part of the sphygmographic curve. It has
also some influence on the height of the curves, because the amplitude
of elastic vibrations depends on the elastic force for a given force of
the shock. The degree of elasticity of the arterial wall is subjected
to individual variations, and it depends in a given subject on the
state of innervation of the wall.</p>

<p>(3) The surrounding tissues have a certain influence, since their resistance
determines the friction opposing the vibration. This accounts
for the fact that merely local conditions, such as a change of the position
of the arm or the adjustment of the instrument, may change the
form of the pulse curve. For instance, if the sphygmogram is taken
from the a. radialis the instrument is placed between the styloid process
of the radius and the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis. In the
neighborhood of this place are two venae comites and a superficial
branch of the median or radial vein. A change in the position of the
arm will have a certain influence on the circulation in the veins, and
influence the turgor of these vessels. Increased turgor increases the
friction, and thus produces the different forms of the tracings.</p>

<p>(4) The changes of the turgor of the artery, moreover, cause a
general rise or lowering of the curve. This symptom is essentially
ambiguous for the turgor of the artery may be changed as well by an
increase or decrease of the amount of blood pumped into the arterial
system as by a decrease or increase of the amount of blood which
passes through the capillaries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>The influences mentioned under (1) may be seen in tracings
taken from cases of cardiac insufficiency, and have merely pathological
interest. All the other influences, however, can be observed in the
curves which are traced for psychological purposes. The changes in
the general rise or fall of the curves are not so very hard to observe,<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
and for the observation of the rapidity of the heart-beats it is only
necessary to trace a time-curve and count the number of beats or
measure the length of every single beat. Also the changes of the height
of the waves can easily be measured. This has been done conscientiously
by several observers. It is by far harder to see the changes in
the form of the catacrotic branch, and only a few keen observers have
seen them. These changes of the pulse curve under the influence of
feelings were proved as facts by experiments, but their interpretation
was doubtful. With the exception of the rapidity of the heart-beats,
which could easily be observed in some other way, all the symptoms
of the influence of feelings on circulation are ambiguous. A difference
in height of the single waves may be due to a change in the amount of
blood which is pumped into the artery, but it also may be due to a
change in the amplitude of the vibrations of the artery. The form of
the catacrotic part of the sphygmographic curve may be changed by a
different state of innervation of the arterial wall, but it also may be due
to an increase or decrease of the friction of the surrounding tissues.
The general rise or fall of the curve may indicate a change in the
amount of blood which leaves the left ventricle, but it also may indicate
a change in the amount of the capillary outflow.</p>

<p>The problem, nevertheless, is fully determined, and a solution is
suggested by the constructions in Fig. 5. The form of the resulting
movement depends, first, on the length of the line <em>AB</em>, secondly, on
the length of the line <em>AE</em>, and thirdly, on the nature of the elastic
movement. An elastic movement is determined if three constants
are known, one of which is the amplitude, the second the friction,
and the third the elasticity. Only <em>AB</em> can be measured directly, and
there remain four unknown quantities to be determined. Four measurements
must be sufficient for this purpose. It is obvious, however,
that not any four measurements will do, but a method can be devised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
by which it is possible to determine each one of these four quantities.
The problem can be solved in every case provided that the sphygmogram
is trustworthy enough to justify the work. The length <em>AB</em> is proportional
to the time of one heart-beat, and the length of the line <em>AE</em> is
proportional to the amount of blood pumped into the arteries. The
successful analysis of the pulse curves, therefore, shows changes of the
action of the heart and makes it possible to distinguish them from the
changes at the periphery.</p>

<p>Besides the length of the heart-beats there are invariably these four
quantities which must be determined by the analysis of the pulse
curves: Amount of incoming blood, amount of outflowing blood,
elasticity of the artery, and friction of the tissues. These quantities
depend on the action of the heart, the peripheral resistance, and the
state of innervation of the artery. It is not possible to discuss here the
bearing of this theory and of the facts which may be connected with it,
on the different views of the localization and operation of the centres
which control these functions. Anatomical and physiological evidence,
however, leaves no doubt that the function of the heart and the innervation
of the arteries and capillaries <em>are</em> under the control of nervous
centres. It may be supposed, therefore, that changes of the pulse
curve like those due to the influence of feelings are the effect of the
function of these centres. It is to be expected that the detailed analysis
of the pulse curves may give some indications as to the nature of this
influence, for it may be observed how the function of these centres
changes under the influence of mental processes.</p>

<p>A complete analysis of the physiological accompaniments of a
feeling process must give a description of the changes in the function
of the heart and the system, besides a description or at least enumeration
of the other changes which can be observed. By a number of
such investigations material for a general theory of physiological
accompaniments of feelings may be obtained, which would not be void
of interest for the psychology of feelings. Such a theory must contain
the answers to the following questions: (1) How do the physiological
reactions depend on the sense-stimulus? (2) How many possible
circulatory reactions are there? (3) What is the location and interdependence
of the respective physiological centres? The first question
cannot so far be answered in general, but it will be possible to give a
general answer when a greater number of systematic investigations on
the effect of sense-stimuli have been carried on. Papers like those of
Mentz may settle the question for certain sense-stimuli. From the
results which have been obtained so far it comes out clearly that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
reaction does not depend merely on the nature of the stimulus, but
that it depends largely on the psychical and physiological state of the
subject. The answer to the second question may be given readily, but
it seems advisable to give it in connection with an experimental investigation.
It may be said, nevertheless, that the number of typical
reactions is rather limited. The third problem, by its nature, cannot
be definitely answered before the location of the respective centres is
ascertained and their interdependence explained.</p>

<p>It is, finally, a merit of this theory of the pulse curves that it shows
how the form of this curve may depend on central processes. The
problem of the mysterious influence of mental processes is thus reduced
to the analysis of merely physiological conditions. The theories on the
nature of this influence are so numerous that they may well be called
innumerable, and they vary from accepting a direct influence of ideas
on the circulation to considering the body as a sounding-board which
by every sensation is shaken in all its parts. Each one of these theories
is also a theory of feelings, and a more or less exact description of
these changes has been often taken for a descriptive psychology
of feelings. The example of the sounding-board is taken from one of
those papers which expound the theory that bodily changes follow
directly on the perception, and that our sensation of these facts is the
emotion. Every one of these bodily changes, whatsoever, is perceived,
acutely or obscurely, the moment it occurs. This theory is defended
by the argument that if we try to abstract from consciousness all
the sensations of our bodily symptoms, we find we have nothing left
behind. This argument, which may be found in almost every paper
that deals with this theory, is remarkable, because it sometimes is
referred to processes of every description, and thus comes into contradiction
with psychophysical parallelism which excludes the acceptance
of psychical states which have no physical correlate. This
theory, as will have been noticed, is the theory of feelings expounded
by James, Lange, Ribot, and others. It is widely accepted, and may be
found also in books of popular or semi-popular nature. Two observations
must be made against this view:</p>

<p>First, a perception of a bodily change which is felt in the moment
the change occurs exists only in the theory, every real process needing
a certain time. This point of the theory may be improved by admitting
that the afferent process lasts as long as any other of the physiological
processes of this kind. Either assumption, however, is contradicted by
the experimental evidence supplied by Lehmann that the physiological
changes occur after the beginning of an emotional state.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>Secondly, if the theory refers only to those bodily changes which we
know, it certainly is not true, for emotional states are sometimes
observed without it being possible to find with modern instruments
any bodily accompaniments. If the theory refers to bodily changes of
every description, it is certainly true, or, better, it is beyond all attack
because it becomes identical with psychophysical parallelism. In this
general form this theory of feelings is as good as no theory at all,
because it refers to mental states of every description.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>This conception of emotional states of mind as perceptions of bodily
sensations would hardly have been promulgated, if the authors had
tried to base it on experiments performed in the laboratory. An emotion
but not the feeling-tone of a simple sensation may be mistaken
for the sum of bodily sensations. It is, furthermore, remarkable that
the promoters of this theory do not make a clear distinction between
sensation and feeling. They introduce an emotional element by calling
the perception of bodily changes a feeling of these changes. Only in
this way do they succeed in building up emotional states of mind out
of elements which are seemingly sensational. This does not succeed if
the word feeling is replaced by the word sensation. The failure of this
theory is due to two facts, first to the starting from a philosophical
doctrine, and second to the lack of a precise distinction between
feeling and sensation. It cannot be doubted after the above discussion
how a definition of this difference may be given which holds for every
empirical investigation.</p>

<p>A sense-stimulus produces a complex of nervous and central processes.
Among these is a certain group of processes which manifest
themselves by changing the innervation of the heart, the blood-vessels,
the lungs, and certain muscles. Another group is formed by those nervous
and central processes which are more or less immediate effects of
the sense-stimulation. The first group of processes is referred subjectively
to an emotional state of mind, and the second to a cognitive process;
the first group of processes is the physiological accompaniment
of feelings, the second that of sensations. The relative independence
of the first group from the second group is warranted by the fact that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
the same processes are observed as accompaniments of ideational processes.
A strict limit between these two groups of processes can be
drawn when the central processes are better known, because to the
first group belong all those processes which are found to be accompaniments
as well of sensational as of ideational processes. In
different sensations the emotional process may be more or less
marked, and in others the cognitive process may be prominent, but it
seems that feelings are an invariable accompaniment of the sensation.
This suggests the definition of feelings as psychic processes, the
physiological accompaniment of which are central processes which
depend largely on the state of the organism, and which manifest themselves
by changes in the innervation of the heart, the blood-vessels, the
lungs, and muscles. The impossibility of directly comparing the
sensations of different subjects is recognized, and it is also impossible
to compare feelings, because in either case we are dealing with
psychic processes.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_MUTUAL_INFLUENCE_OF_FEELINGS" id="THE_MUTUAL_INFLUENCE_OF_FEELINGS"></a>THE MUTUAL INFLUENCE OF FEELINGS</h2>

<p class="p1b">BY JOHN A. H. KEITH</p>


<p>The object of this investigation was to ascertain the mutual influence
of simultaneous stimuli that appealed to different senses
with regard to the <em>intensity</em> of their feeling values. The investigation
covers combinations: (1) of colors and active touches, (2) of
colors and passive touches, (3) of tones and active touches, (4) of
tones and passive touches, (5) of colors and tones.</p>

<p>The basis of appreciation was a numerical scale<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> as follows:</p>

<ul class="index">
 <li>1. Very disagreeable.</li>
 <li>2. Disagreeable.</li>
 <li>3. Slightly disagreeable.</li>
 <li>4. Indifferent.</li>
 <li>5. Slightly agreeable.</li>
 <li>6. Agreeable.</li>
 <li>7. Very agreeable.</li>
</ul>


<p>The color series began with the one hundred thirty-six colors as
put out by the Milton Bradley Co. This series consists of ninety
pure spectrum colors, ten whites, blacks, and grays, and thirty-six
broken spectrum colors. The colors were exposed at the back of a
semicircular black-lined box for about two seconds. The subject
was seated at a convenient distance, about three and a half feet,
from the colors. In order to have a constant light, all experiments
were conducted in a dark room with an electric light suspended
over the subject's head. The whole series was used for ten times
in order to get the range of judgments. Then twenty-eight colors,
covering as fully as possible the range from 1 to 7, were selected
for further experiment in combination.</p>

<p>At the same time a series of thirty-six touches, from velvet to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
sandpaper, was being employed as the colors were. From this number
fourteen were finally selected.</p>

<p>Similarly, by using a reed box, with reeds ranging from 128 to
1024 vibrations per second and separated from each other by four
vibrations, from a much larger series twenty-seven tone-combinations
were finally selected.</p>

<p>Moreover, from time to time, each selected series was given alone;
and on the basis of these readings, averaging from thirty to forty,
the "standard" for each stimulus was made. Tables I to III give
a brief description of the stimuli and also the "standards" for each
of two subjects, F. and M.</p>

13, 15 and 14. The first sixteen are harmonious; so also the twenty-sixth;
the others introduce beats and discords, some of which are
agreeable, as 20 and 21, while others are disagreeable, as 19 and
27. Individual differences appear in this as in the previous series.
The totals introduced into the tables simply go to show that in
each series the total judgments are not widely diverse.</p>

<p>Under combination influences, the average is reduced to 4.14+ for
colors, and 3.12 for tones.</p>

<p>The next Table, V, shows the color-tone results for F. as Table IV
showed them for M. F.'s average for colors (Table I) alone was
4.35, and was reduced in combination with tones by .26, or to 4.19.
So, also, F.'s average for tones alone (Table III), 4.33, was reduced
by .74+ to 3.59. The averages in both cases show the same general
tendency to a lowering of the appreciation in both series when
the series are combined, but the tones are lowered more than the
colors.</p>

<p>Table VI shows the effect of combining tones and active touches
as reported by M.</p>

<p>The effect of this combination is clear and unmistakeable. The
appreciation of the tones is raised 1.71+ points; and of the active
touches, .31+ points. This result is the opposite of that shown in
Table IV, where colors and tones were combined. There is this
agreement, however, that the appreciation of the tones is changed
more than that of the other stimuli. Relatively, the appreciation
of the touches changes least.</p>

<p>Table VII shows the effects on F. of combining tones and active
touches. The same general tendencies appear as in the case of M.;
but the changes in appreciation are not so marked. This is not easy
to explain, for F. estimated both the active touches and the tones
higher when taken alone than did M.</p>

<p>Table VIII shows the effect on F. of combining tones and passive
touches. The same general tendency to increased appreciation appears,
but the tones are raised more and the touches raised less
than in Table VII. This may be explained, perhaps, on the basis
of increasing appreciation with increased participation.</p>

<p>Tables IX and X show the effect on M. and F., respectively,
of combining colors and active touches. M. estimates both slightly
higher, while F. estimates both slightly lower. This difference cannot
be explained by the standards for each subject. From Tables
I and III we get:</p>

<p>Evidently no dynamic explanation of this difference is possible. It
has been impossible to reveal the cause of this particular difference;
in all other respects, however, the subjects agree in the general
tendencies revealed.</p>

<p>There remain the combinations of colors and passive touches.
These combinations are shown in Tables XI and XII.</p>

<p>In these tables the same general tendency to estimate both higher
when colors and passive touches are combined appears. M. raises
the colors more than F., and F. raises the touches more than M.
This is perfectly regular, as the following table shows:</p>

<p>From this last table certain conclusions may be drawn.</p>

<p>(1) When Colors and Tones were combined, both were lowered
in the appreciation of both subjects. The percentages show:
(<em>a</em>) That about the same number of colors was lowered, 59.6% for
F. and 59% for M. (<em>b</em>) That about the same average displacement
of colors occurred, .26+ for F. and .29+ for M. (<em>c</em>) That about the
same number of tones was lowered, 77% for F. and 81% for M.
(<em>d</em>) That the tones were lowered more for M., -.74+ for F., and
1.08+ for M.</p>

<p>(2) When Colors and Active Touches were combined, for F. both
are lowered; for M. both are raised. The colors are lowered only
very slightly, .13 for F, while for M they are raised .43+; and
conversely, the active touches are lowered .38+ for F, and raised
only .17+ for M. Still, it appears clear that with F. there was an
interference,&mdash;and both colors and active touches are lowered
while the same combinations with M. are mutually reÃ«nforcing.</p>

<p>(3) When Colors and Passive Touches were combined, the appreciation
of both was raised for both F. and M. The result shows:
(<em>a</em>) That the percentages of colors and passive touches raised are
practically the same for both F. and M. (<em>b</em>) That the color displacement
is greater for M. than for F., being +.72+ for M. and only
.40+ for F. (<em>c</em>) That there is only a slight difference in the displacement
of the passive touches.</p>

<p>(4) When Tones and Active Touches were combined, the appreciation
of both was raised for both F. and M. It appears (<em>a</em>) that
the displacement for F. is very slight, .45+ and .23+, when compared
with the displacement for M., 1.71+ and .31+. But, (<em>b</em>)
that the displacement of tones is greater than that of the active
touches for both F. and M. (<em>c</em>) That this same relatively great displacement
of tones occurred in the opposite direction when colors
and tones were combined.</p>

<p>(5) When Tones and Passive Touches were combined, the appreciation
of both was raised for F,&mdash;the tones being raised more
than the passive touches. This combination was not tried with M.
for lack of time.</p>

<p>From time to time some special tests of these general tendencies
were applied. From the results already set forth, one could predict
that there was a strong probability that when the tone-series was
combined with a constant touch-series, active or passive, the appreciation
of the tones would be raised. This was tried by allowing
the subject M. to rub his hand over the somewhat rough pillow of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
a tilting board. The results showed that the appreciation of twenty-five
out of twenty-seven tones was raised. Other predictions were
similarly verified.</p>

<p>Of course, any experiment of this nature is exposed to a great
many chances of error. The subjects may be fatigued, or depressed
generally. But the wide range of different readings taken is a reasonable
assurance that the chances of error are minimized. And it
is to be noted, also, that individual differences of appreciation do
not vitiate the results. In getting the "standards" no less than 2000
judgments were given by each subject, while for the tables each
subject gave no less than 4000 judgments. The curves made from
these data show the effect of each separate combination by their variation
from the standard. The tables and analyses and conclusions
already introduced show, in general, that <em>our appreciation of each
of several stimuli in combination is different from our appreciation
of the same stimuli when taken separately</em>. The results show that
this appreciation may be either raised or lowered; that is to say,
our feeling of values is not constant for a given stimulus under all
conditions.</p>

<p>From Table XIII I have found the average displacement of each
series to be as follows:</p>

<ul class="index">
<li>Tones, .90.</li>
<li>Colors, .37.</li>
<li>A. Touches, .28.</li>
<li>P. Touches, .23.</li>
</ul>


<p>This shows that passive touches are subject to the least displacement,
while active touches, colors, and tones are respectively subject
to a greater variation. The sight-touch world is more stable than
the auditory world. With M. the tones go over a full point both
below and above the standard.</p>

<p>This report does not treat of the particular effects of a qualitative
nature that follow from the possible combinations of series of
stimuli of different feeling values,&mdash;such as the effect of an agreeable
touch upon a slightly disagreeable tone, or upon an indifferent
color, and so on. All such effects can be traced by rearranging
the data already collected, and this may be done in a subsequent
paper which may enter also into the theoretical discussion of the
whole problem.</p>

<h2>THE COMBINATION OF FEELINGS</h2>

<p class="p1b">BY C. H. JOHNSTON</p>


<p>The problem at issue in the present investigation concerns the
combination of feelings. On the basis of theories as different in
many respects as those of Wundt, of Titchener, of Lipps, etc., the
feeling-state is always a unity. The affective process for Wundt must
be always "coextensive with consciousness." When he chooses to
speak of a "mixed feeling," it never for him signifies a "mosaic in
consciousness," but is always a new <em>TotalgefÃ¼hl</em>, which "swamps
consciousness as a whole."</p>

<p>Titchener also believes that with every affective experience an
inevitable and pervasive "tilting" of the whole organism occurs.
W. McDougall, in his recent Physiological Psychology, makes the
general statement that always a "massive state of feeling results"
when many sensations are simultaneously excited, and that in such
case we cannot "introspectively distinguish the feeling-tone of each
sensation."</p>

<p>We started to examine by experiment and by introspection which
feeling-effect really results from a combination of various impressions
with affective tone, and whether it is really impossible that various
feelings coexist and remain distinguishable. In case they can coexist,
the question arises: What mutual influences can be discovered?</p>

<p>For the main part of our study the simplest possible feelings were
chosen, because here presumably the subjects will not be forced to
grapple with complex personal psychoses, necessarily confusing from
their very richness. It was thought that here they could be more
nearly normal, naÃ¯ve, less artificial, and able to a maximum to rid
themselves of preconceived personal opinions and unaccountable
associations. Here, with simplest stimulations, unsophisticated necessarily,
the hope at any rate is that work with a good number of subjects
of distinct emotional temperaments may bring to light certain
fresh simple introspective facts, which may in their turn offer valuable
considerations concerning the psychology of feeling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>Throughout the course of the experiment, except in the advanced
stage when more complex states were under consideration, sounds,
colors, odors, simple figures, and tactual surfaces were used. In the
late stage of the investigation sentences and pictures more or less
morally and Ã¦sthetically suggestive served to furnish for study the
complex feeling-states.</p>

<p>The progress of the investigation divides itself naturally into the
following four distinct parts.</p>

<p>I. From every experience of each individual the investigator sought
to obtain from the subject's own introspection at the time as adequate
a description as possible of the particular feeling provoked by
the chosen stimulus. The feelings studied in this first period of the
investigation are entirely those which heretofore have not been at all
classified except in terms of the objects which call them forth. Part I
is concerned with single stimuli affecting only one kind of sense-organ,
visual, tactual, auditory, or olfactory as the case may be.</p>

<p>Two requests were made of each subject, viz:</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) To describe as clearly as possible how the particular experience
<em>felt</em>.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) To report always all the accompanying physiological or physical
processes which seemed to <em>mean</em>, to result from, or apparently only
accidentally to accompany the stimulus judged by him to have a
feeling-tone.</p>

<p>The work of the experiment covers a period of two years, and fortunately
several of the subjects were available for the whole period.
No subject was used for more than two hours each week. In the preparatory
training with sensations from only one sense-organ, the range
of colors, odors, etc., was chosen as follows: Twenty colors, and as
many tactual surfaces, etc., were presented in turn, and each subject
was requested to make his judgment as to the relative degree of agreeableness
or disagreeableness of the feelings arising in the several cases.
The scale of numbers from 1 to 7 served in the traditional way to
indicate approximately the hedonic value of the feeling-tones, 1 signifying
highest degree of pleasure, 2 very pleasant, 3 slightly pleasant,
4 indifferent, 5 slightly unpleasant, 6 very unpleasant, and 7 the
highest degree of unpleasantness. Though the personal differences
were in some cases rather striking, the individual subject from day to
day showed a relatively constant standard. This was done in order
simply to be able to choose approximately the stimulus in the individual
case likely to call up the <em>kind</em> of feeling one wished to study
more in detail, and thus facilitate the progress of the investigation. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
this preliminary stage pleasant or unpleasant seemed to the subjects
more or less an exhaustive account of these faint feelings. This was
a means of eliminating practically indifferent shades, as there is here
no special interest in the psychology of color as such.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>II. Following upon this preparatory training, the second part of
the experiment consisted in a similar study of the <em>mutual influences</em> of
<em>simultaneous feelings</em> accompanying sensations from different sense-organs.
How does the feeling of pleasure obtained from contact with
a smooth surface influence the feeling occasioned by the <em>sight</em> of a
pleasant or unpleasant object? Here, for example, colors were exposed
in a large black frame manipulated by means of shutters easily opened
or closed, at the same time that a tactual surface was being applied, or
a tone from a tuning-fork was being sounded.</p>

<p>The introspection method was essentially the same here as in Part I.</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) First, the subject was requested, without the necessary distraction
of directing his attention at all to the bodily processes, to give
himself up to the situation and to report as accurately as he could the
kind of affective state experienced.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) Next, as in Part I again, in a repetition of the same experience,
he was requested to be on the lookout for any and all accompanying
bodily changes. The problem here was to discover to what extent the
more complex state now in question would correspond to the specific
and noticeable bodily reactions such as were noted in Part I, where
single experiences presumably resulted. If different feeling-elements
are in experience at once, can one fix upon correspondingly different
suggested actions? Does the organism react to more than one situation,
or to two sources of stimulation at once? Is affection present only
when the whole organism is, to use Titchener's expression, "tilted"
one way? Is the TotalgefÃ¼hl the single undifferentiated result always,
or can we here also detect such phenomena as summation, fusion,
inhibition, and partial or total mutual reÃ«nforcement of the different
feeling-components? Do the new reactions which seem to mean the
feelings always refer to actions so inclusive as to result in the inhibition
of any other tendencies to response, or is there sometimes a clear strife
between two simultaneously conflicting feelings, two kinds of relatively
self-dependent reactions both going on at once? Or again, when
the hedonic or algedonic characters of two given simultaneous stimuli,
such as a soft, soothing, pleasant touch with an irritating, exhilarating,
invigorating but also pleasant yellow color, do not differ as to their
pleasant-unpleasant character, must one be pale and empty "intellectual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
perception" when the other is being enjoyed? These are some
of the questions that suggest themselves at once.</p>

<p>Not at this point, however, considering the dimensionality of feeling,
the four simple combinations were first studied; such, for example,
as (1) a pleasant color with a pleasant touch, (2) pleasant color with
unpleasant touch, (3) unpleasant color with pleasant touch, and (4)
unpleasant color with unpleasant touch.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>III. This part of the work was an attempt to estimate the average
time-interval in which feeling-tones develop, and what influences other
feelings given simultaneously or immediately beforehand have upon
the time-development of the feeling-tone in question. Will certain
feelings hasten and others retard a third feeling whose character
remains unchanged when it crosses the limen of awareness? Does
the feeling, for example, aroused by contact with a soft, soothing,
yielding tactual surface, put one in such a state that he will more or
less quickly obtain pleasure from the visual impression coming from a
soft rich red color? What effect will a feeling already aroused by a low
tone have upon the time development of the feeling one gets from
looking at a deep green color? Are there, again, pleasant feelings of
certain dimensions which will be hastened by other feelings, and still
others which, by the same means, will be retarded? If so, under what
general principle do they seem to fall?</p>

<p>Here the time-development of a certain feeling-tone is taken when
there are no other influencing factors. Then the comparison of this
rate is made with the later reported time-interval when that feeling,
again aroused, has been immediately preceded or accompanied by
a feeling-tone from another source of stimulation. Here also feelings
for colors presented in a frame, without any special suggestion of form
in connection with them, were in like manner compared as to their
time-development with the affective states arising from those same
colors presented again enclosed in cardboard frames of special character.
Some of these forms were very pleasing, such as upright ovals,
small circles, etc., while others, frames cut purposely into irregular
shapes, were to most observers decidedly unpleasant.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>IV. Here complex feeling-states were in question, and evidence
was sought as to how much could be detected here that would tend to
substantiate or to call in question what seemed to be the fundamental
principles of feeling-relations where the states are very simple.
Further complications, such as three and even more stimulations at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
once, were tested. After this, feelings aroused by looking at pictures of
statues were studied and described as accurately as possible. "Perry
Pictures" were used. <em>Dying Alexander</em>, <em>Venus of Milo</em>, the <em>Dying
Gladiator</em>, the <em>LaocoÃ¶n</em> group, and <em>Apollo Belvedere</em>, served to introduce
sufficient variety. Then copies of these same statues were cut out
from the card and presented to the subject with the same colors before
studied used as background. These were allowed to play their part in
the feeling aroused therefrom.</p>

<p>After this, pictures more or less morally as well as Ã¦sthetically suggestive
were used. Millet's <em>Angelus</em> and his <em>Shepherdess Knitting</em> and
Rosa Bonheur's <em>Horse Fair</em> afforded suggestion hints as to the contrasted
motor significance of the complex states called forth. Here the
attempt was made to find out in how far the feeling when once aroused
is dependent upon the retained after-images or memory-images of the
original visual stimulation, and what sort of feelings tend the longer to
persist. Or again when both are taken in in quick succession, what
sort of imagery and associations result. Are the resulting associations
or images colored by both feeling-tones in any definite way? And if
the feeling itself persists despite the loss of imagery, can it be referred
merely to more internal sensations, or does there seem to be a necessity
to consider it of purely central origin?</p>

<p>Such, in brief outline, has been the proposed method of study. In
an experiment of this delicate nature there are clearly many things
to guard against. There is danger that the investigator will unwittingly
make suggestions to the subjects by his questions. There is
a great danger of auto-suggestion on the part of the subject. The likelihood
is also considerable that the subjects will fall into stereotyped
forms of expression and general listlessness in introspection, where
from week to week these simple experiences are being repeated for
closer and closer examination. Again the special mood of the day will
necessarily tend to affect all such feeling-attitudes toward slight stimulations
supposed to have a feeling-tone. These and other dangers were
recognized at the outset, and avoided as much as possible by such
legitimate variations as could be introduced without changing the
general purpose of the work. No subject was used when he felt, for
whatever reason, unable to adapt himself to the conditions of the
experiment. No subject knew anything of the recorded results of the
others, and it was constantly urged that each person should wholly
regard the present feeling in question, ignoring any remembered tone
which that special stimulation had before afforded him.</p>

<p>It very soon became evident that the variations among individuals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
especially as to the amount of feeling and the consequent ability to
fix upon the special physical processes involved, were considerable.
The subjects represent types. Hence, it seems necessary at once to
mention briefly some characteristics of the persons themselves who
have reported these various experiences. This was kept in mind
throughout, and seems of decided significance in the interpretation
of the recorded results. After an examination of the results of each
individual, whatever remains that is common to all will be briefly
summarized.</p>

<p>All the subjects were graduate students in Harvard University or
in Radcliffe College. Seven of the twelve had had from one to five
or more years' training in laboratory investigations. Two subjects
were ladies, the rest were gentlemen.</p>

<p>Subject A was a man of bright cheerful pleasant even temperament,
responsive, very musical, alert, physically vigorous, very careful in
statement, and decided as to the distinctness of his emotional states.
He uses his facial muscles a good deal while conversing.</p>

<p>Subject B is musical, sings a good deal, is not especially demonstrative,
nor always able to become adapted to the necessarily oft-repeated
stimulations from the same colors and tones. This subject is especially
discriminating as to shades, and has decided preferences for certain
colors.</p>

<p>Subject C usually found it difficult to find any decided feeling-tone
for many of the stimuli used. This subject is rather reserved and
undemonstrative as a rule. He is not at all musical, nor does he care
for art. He is a rather cool but extremely careful observer, and is
always guarded in his introspection.</p>

<p>Subject D is impulsive habitually, flashy, responsive, especially to
any suggestion of an Ã¦sthetic nature, such as forms, and very decided
as to his experiences. He walks with a quick nervous step, is sprightly
always, vivacious in conversation and outspoken.</p>

<p>Subject E is rather non-emotional as he often says. He is very
energetic, full of life, quick but not precise in all his movements,
always on a tension, does not enjoy without effort anything so mild
as the stimulations here used, and finds introspection of this affective
nature difficult.</p>

<p>Subject F is careful, experienced in introspective work, musical,
talks a great deal, enjoys this kind of work, has decided preferences, is
athletic and energetic. This subject makes use of facial, arm, and
shoulder gestures quite freely in general conversation.</p>

<p>Subject G has a penchant for talking a great deal, is decided in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
likes and dislikes, musical, of an uneven temperament, sometimes
cheerful, often cross, but always animated.</p>

<p>Subject H confesses he does not ever especially enjoy colors, nor
respond with any sign of demonstration to any situations. He is
steady, calm, apparently unruffled, and not an especially acute observer
of his own states, proving in this experiment unusually undiscriminative
as to simple experiences.</p>

<p>Subject I is rather morose, claiming to be habitually unmoved by
even display of great passion or excitement. He finds it generally
much easier to call up unpleasant than pleasant experiences, this
being exceptional among the subjects. He is much slower than the
average, and his feelings are not easily aroused. He is deliberative
and confident as to his state of mind. He is nervous and often becomes
fatigued before the hour's introspective work is over.</p>

<p>Subject J is nervous, of an uneven temperament, emotional, and
quick to react to a situation of any kind, and, rather more than the
others, subject to suggestion.</p>

<p>Subject K responds very quickly always, is habitually prompt and
clear in statement, of an even temperament, and unusually interested
in the experiment.</p>

<p>Subject L is unexperienced in this particular kind of work, but
slow and careful. Though athletic, his movements are rather heavy.
He is deliberate in speech and of an even, though rather undemonstrative
temperament. He also is musical.</p>

<p>In order to verify my somewhat personal descriptions here recorded
a questionnaire was given each subject to fill out according to his own
personal judgment of his emotional disposition. This was done toward
the close of the investigation, and the answers agree in the main with
the descriptions offered above.</p>

<p>For the first month's preliminary practice, and with the purpose of
stimulating curiosity and interest, and of testing the comparative
richness of even slight feeling-experiences, a great variety of stimulations
was used. Twenty different tactual surfaces from softest
plush to very rough sandpaper served for the tactual impressions.
Twelve different odors, as many colors differing in saturation and
intensity, and tones from high and low tuning-forks, and noises variously
produced, were employed as stimulations for the other senses.
Besides these, circles, upright and horizontal ovals of various sizes,
imperfect circles and ovals, and other irregular shapes were all presented
in the same large black frame. When studied alone indifferent
gray fillings were used. When complex states were in question colors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
served as fillings. When the subjects thus became accustomed to these
very simple but very definitely <em>felt</em> experiences, in these for the most
part habitually ignored affective elements of ordinary sensations,
the investigation at once became narrowed to more careful and minute
attention to a few of these feeling-tones. It was soon found also that
odors could not easily be used in combination, since they effectively
effaced all feeling-tones for the simultaneously given colors or touches.
Five colors, fairly representative for all subjects of different kinds of
feeling-tones, were chosen, and were used throughout the whole investigation.
These were the following: a soft deep red, light brilliant yellow,
deep pure green, saturated blue, and a dingy greenish-yellow.
The dimensions of the exposed surfaces were six by six inches.</p>

<p>For tactual impressions of approximately equal value soft plush,
velvet, and two kinds of sandpaper were used, and for tones high and
low tuning-forks. All the above-named forms were used in connection
with the chosen colors. The subjects differed considerably as to the
<em>amount</em> of feeling that could be obtained from such material. The
variation of kinds and of intensity in the same subject was sometimes
noticeable from day to day, but not great. It is hardly necessary to
give detailed quotations from each subject. The following summary
of the results of the experimental work, however, contains nothing
that was not frequently reported by a majority of the subjects. This,
then, does not represent at all what was once or occasionally reported
by individual subjects, but what after training seemed to be reliable
and definite and constant feeling-states.</p>


<h3>P<span class="smcapa">ART</span> I</h3>

<p><em>Section A.</em> The following are the collected expressions which many
subjects used to describe the feeling for this <em>particular shade of red</em>.
It feels as if it would be soft. It suggests warmth. The feeling is one
of seriousness, pleasantness, quietness, of free repose,&mdash;a full feeling
of the sense of safety. It is soothing, rich, full of strength, and inviting.
One feels restful, grave, calm, appeased. There is an agreeable longing
and a tendency to lose one's self in the color. The feeling is one of
comfort, luxury, satisfaction, expansiveness, tranquillity, and quiescence,
with no accompanying feeling of weakness by exertion of
effort or energy. There is neither marked tension on the one hand, nor
collapse on the other. There is a sense rather of easy self-control and
command of one's body, but with no aggressive sorrow nor joy element,&mdash;a
feeling of being attracted, with nothing to suggest any
obstacle to the adaptation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>Occasionally to all subjects this color, and, indeed, all colors,
seemed "dead," arousing no feeling whatever. Here the color "ought
to be pleasant," but is only "for the time potentially not actually
actively pleasant." Still more rarely did this red appear to be unpleasant.
Some subjects thought that this afforded the greatest
<em>amount of sensual pleasure</em>. More than any of the other colors they
think it appears to "give you something." It does not so much stimulate
as furnish a content itself. It has a direct effect rather than
a tendency to make one wish to do something and thus give pleasure
from the activity itself. Only one subject failed to find this color
pleasant. His early association of it with blood and ghastly scenes
could not be overcome. Some others, when a glare or glaze appeared
on the red, found in it slight suggestions of stimulation and excitement,
but the general decision in the great majority of cases was that
the feeling was a sort of emotional massiveness compared with the
effects from other colors.</p>

<p>In marked contrast, for the most part, appears the characteristic
feeling-tone for our chosen shade of <em>yellow</em>. Almost universally subjects
find such words as these descriptive of the feeling here in question.
It is cheerful, brisk, pleasant<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> also, bright, gay, light, sprightly,
merry, jovial, easy to get, pleasantly irritating, stimulating, stirring,
spurring, thrilling, invigorating, and produces agreeable discontent.
It is jolly, nice, trim, neat, awakening, full of the sense of motion,
soaring, and arouses a feeling of welcome strain, of pleasure in action,
of alertness and self-assertion. Here, in contrast for the most part
to the red, there is no feeling of sinking into the color. The impulse
rather is to be free, to enjoy motor expression, even if of some vague
sort. There is a <em>felt</em> necessity to do something, a "joy of overflowing
or of exuberance," it is called. There is little present here of what we
mean by a suggestion of sensual richness found above in the feeling
for red. Here there is less of amount of pleasure, but much more of
the general activity element. Some subjects feel the demand for
greater saturation, and occasionally it is unpleasant for just this
reason apparently. Subjects C and B frequently reported this. They
think the feeling would be more "stable" and "grave" and "secure"
and "soothing" and one would not feel "unruffled," if it could be
"toned down." Most of the subjects, however, think that it belongs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
to the ultimate elemental feeling for yellow that it should have just
this distinguishing characteristic.</p>

<p>It is more difficult to describe the feeling for <em>green</em>. It is almost
always agreeable. Two subjects, however, never like it. Sometimes
it is somewhat soothing in character, but more often it is exciting.
The feeling seems to be between that for red and that for yellow,
partaking on the whole of the characters of feeling for the latter rather
than the former. For all subjects associations tend to color the feeling-tone
for green especially, and hence introspection for the feeling of
pure color is doubly difficult. The most prominent partial feeling-tone
for it is "irritating."<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> The agreeableness or disagreeableness of this
stimulating character is particularly inconstant, varying greatly for
the same subject, as well as for different subjects.</p>

<p>The feeling for the <em>blue</em> seems still more to be dependent upon the
person. Many like it. Many others dislike it decidedly. When it
affords a pleasant feeling, it is described in some such terms as these:
The feeling is spiritual, lofty, beautiful, serene. The subject himself
feels immoveable. To other subjects it is too rich and intense and
painful. To one subject who heartily dislikes it always, it is offensive
or revolting, calling up a feeling akin to the emotion one has toward
insincerity in general. To none does this feeling seem to have any
great amount of sensual significance. Even when it is called "too
rich," the incongruity between the richness itself and the ultimate
qualitative significance of the blue is spoken of. Even when pleasant,
the feeling is of an "airy pleasure," volatile, unstable, and not reliable,
nor safe and secure as is the feeling for red. One feels that it is always
apt to vanish, vague, intangible, and with little immediate definiteness
of meaning. Subjects often desire to call it an intellectual, Ã¦sthetic,
or ideal sort of feeling.</p>

<p>No color was universally unpleasant. Two subjects found this
<em>greenish-yellow</em> almost always mildly pleasant. For most of the subjects,
however, it was unpleasant. Here were reported feelings of contraction,
of withdrawal, of disgust, of doubt, of hesitation, of stimulation
without definiteness, dissatisfaction, slight feeling of nausea, of sea-sickness,
of opposition, and the general feeling of offensiveness. The
necessary, unpleasant aggressiveness, unrest, or discontent characterizes
this feeling. This unpleasant critical attitude where a decision
is wanted but not easily gotten, is called often the feeling of uncertainty.</p>

<p>In no sense is this investigation a study of the psychology of color;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
the only purpose here is to find certain clearly defined feelings for
slight stimulations, in order to find in what way they relate themselves
to other similarly simple feelings from a different source of stimulation.</p>

<p>In a similar manner, then, the investigation was conducted in the
analysis and description of feeling-tones for <em>tactual impressions</em>.</p>

<p>For <em>plush</em> there was a feeling of pleasure, ease, safety, and content.
The mood was one of a general enjoyment of sinking one's self into
the situation, an agreeable self-surrender. Here also is a feeling of
unbending one's self, of general expansiveness, of relaxation. One is
soothed, enjoys a suggestion of freedom from disturbance, of a
"regularity" of the experience, feels at the same time strength in the
suggested repose, responds to pleasant reverberating thrills by the
falling off from the accustomed muscular tonicity, and hence has a
decided feeling of satisfaction. To some subjects the feeling aroused
by the hard, polished, glazed tin surface, possessing no "yielding"
character, corresponded more nearly to the feeling for the yellow color
than for the red. To all red "went best" with the plush. No tactual
feelings offered such distinguishable elements for analysis, nor were
they as definitely described as the visual or olfactory or auditory
impressions. The sensational elements were in many cases more
pronounced. The feeling for the plush, however, much like that for
the red color, suggests a "settling down to," or a "dropping forward
toward," rather than an aggressive "taking in" of the feeling-material.</p>

<p>The feeling-tone with sensations from sandpaper is grating, irritating,
stirring, stimulating. The feeling is one of contraction, of
withdrawal, of uneasiness. One is full of "collapsing chills," of
minute little pains, and there is a decided call for an opposite kind
of behavior. The sense of weakness, of waste of power and energy,
of being penetrated, of strained expectation, of unwelcome tension,
and of slight "wasteful excitement" results. To some subjects,
notably subject E, at times the whole feeling of stimulation as such
predominated, and the total effect produced was agreeable, as it
"satisfied a felt need of waking up." Here again one subject, subject
B, throughout the whole period of two years, failed to find any element
of pleasure in any tactual sensation that was pronounced or prolonged
sufficiently to furnish material for introspection.</p>

<p>As regards simple <em>tones</em> from tuning-forks the subjects find little
to say. All are pleasant, as a rule, and almost universally, <em>low tones</em>
are most pleasant, richer in content, greater in amount of "general
appeal," more soothing, and pleasantly stimulating. The feeling of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
the easy attitude called for contributes to the whole feeling. <em>High
tones</em>, calling for more activity on the part of the subject, more strain,
and greater stimulation, coupled with some rather unprepared-for
irritating elements, are less pleasant, and also more limited in their
general appeal to the whole organism. The noises variously produced
were at first unpleasant, and the only assignable reason seemed to be
that their suddenness came as a shock. If expected or continued they
too became pleasant very often.</p>

<p>Feelings for <em>forms</em> seem to relate even more definitely to the activity
element. The pleasure for the most part is described as being far less
sensual, if indeed, so at all. Small <em>upright ovals</em>, 1Â½ Ã 1 in., are most
pleasant, because somehow they are "more suggestive of definiteness."
<em>Circles</em> one inch in diameter are next in order of value as to their
feeling-tones. <em>Horizontal ovals</em> are less pleasant still, though for most
subjects not unpleasant. Upright ovals are best, as the kind of action
apparently called for by the aroused feeling is most agreeable and
suitable to the subject's natural upright position of body. An explanation
of this general result of introspection, as well as the preference
for the particular size chosen almost without exception, is attempted
in another part of this report, where are given in more detail the various
kinds of bodily accompaniments. The feelings for those ovals have
also the characters of stimulation, mild excitement, and a feeling of
easy freedom in a pleasing kind of activity. Tension is always present
as an agreeable element when reported at all. This element is coupled
with the "feeling of assurance of certainty" which the whole situation
calls for. It often seems clearly to suggest that one do something.
Circles tend more to suggest inner stability and completeness. They
stand on their own axes. Here there is a sense of satisfaction, complacency,
and sufficiency. The feeling here of a call for immediate activity
on the part of the subject is weak and indefinite, when not altogether
absent. The subjects do not use for this experience such expressions
as excitement, tension, irritation, quick contraction, or the impulse
to self-assertion. Horizontal ovals are least pleasant, it seems to me,
for obvious reasons. Here such noted elements as "felt unnaturalness,"
"difficulty of adapting one's self," "wrong direction of activity,"
which alone and in themselves would be unpleasant, are nevertheless
more than counterbalanced by other and pleasing elements, such as
symmetry, definiteness, partial stability, and other agreeable features.
Often these latter features are not pronounced, and then the judgment
is, that the total feeling is unpleasant.</p>

<p>Likewise as regards so-called bad forms, no single statement is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
unqualifiedly true of any considerable number of subjects. The
decided feeling of irregularity, the "bulging-out" or the undesirable
"pushing-in" of the figure, the feeling of weakness in one's own body
corresponding, the feeling of instability which one tends himself to
imitate in various ways, the total effect of lack of poise, all tend to
make these figures on the whole unpleasant. But one cannot even
here count upon the constancy of the subjects' feelings. At times, due
perhaps to undercurrents of association processes of which even the
subject himself is not clearly aware, the figure suddenly looms up as
quite definitely pleasing, and full of vague suggestiveness and hidden
richness of content. These varying characters of the feelings for forms
come out interestingly later in the study of them when they are presented
as frames for the above described colors.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><em>Section B.</em> The bodily processes noted by the subjects are numerous,
and here also, just as with the amount of feeling above, the personal
differences are striking. Some subjects detect a great many forms
of organic commotion, others rarely find anything that can be said to
be descriptive or explanatory of the feeling-state. To all of them at
first this looking for bodily accompaniments destroyed the feeling
itself. Only after considerable training was it possible for them to
find any physiological processes that seemed at all significant. As a
general statement the evidence would all tend to suggest that feelings
for color are most readily and directly referred to the head, face,
throat, and particularly to the forehead and to the eye-muscles. When,
however, the feelings are particularly strong, they tend to pervade the
whole organism. Red thus often brings about the suggestion of general
bodily comfort, and yellow, when very strong, arouses the impulses
calling for "spreading-out, aggressive movements," referred to
arms, shoulders, and chest. Tones have in general the same reference
to the head. Odors are always more organic, affecting more directly
the respiration, muscles of the abdomen, and the more internal apparatus
generally. Tactual impressions refer to the trunk rather than to
the face, hand, arms, or legs. Forms seem to call forth imitative movements,
and the actual or incipient motor impulses refer to the action
of the eyes in motion, the position of the head, of the whole body, of
the shoulders particularly, of the shaping of the cheeks, lips, etc., and
of the similarly imitative actions in the hands and arms. The following
is a list collected from the reported bodily references given for
the feelings described in Part I, Section A.</p>

<p>(1) Free full respiration and free activity of all voluntary muscles;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
or, for other feelings, the checking of respiration and often the lack of
impulse to move at all, with no suggestion, however, in most cases,
of lassitude.</p>

<p>(2) Chest expansion and general relief pervading the whole body.
The expansion or contraction is further modified by the <em>degree</em> of
<em>regularity</em> and by the <em>rate</em> of the movements involved, as also by the
ease or <em>difficulty</em> in the performance. So also, in the cases of feeling
whose tone exists but is doubtful in character, the bodily situation
seems to mean "lack of movement or change in any definite direction."
The feeling-tone and its vividness are interdependent and reported as
closely connected.</p>

<p>(3) A cringing all over and a "holding up of all activities."</p>

<p>(4) Abdomen contraction, chest and shoulders drawn in, hands
clenched, and jaws set.</p>

<p>(5) A feeling at once in different parts of the body of both process
of contraction and expansion.</p>

<p>(6) An incipient feeling of nausea in the digestive tract.</p>

<p>(7) A tendency to incline the head forward or backward, or to keep
it rigid, or to turn it aside.</p>

<p>(8) For touch, waves, reverberations, pleasant penetrating thrills
in the chest and abdomen especially, less frequently in the limbs,
occur. Sometimes these suggest expansion of the whole frame; sometimes,
even when also pleasant, the tendency to contraction and tension
is noticeable, but in these latter cases the contraction seems to
be rather definitely the calling into action of those general innervated
muscles which refer to the bodily situation of one when he intends to
go toward the pleasantly stimulating object.</p>

<p>(9) For unpleasant touch the reference or localization of the bodily
response is, when reported definitely at all, generally in the back,
described as chills not thrills, contractions always, contractions also
which often suggest shivers of withdrawal. These feelings also are
referred to the situation of the trunk of the body, and are felt to
originate in the small of the back, and in the back of the shoulders.
For two subjects there occur twitchings in the tendons of the hips
and thighs, and movements of the knee-cap.</p>

<p>(10) The pervasive bodily collapse, which seems to accompany
feelings characterized as depressing, altogether unlike the soothing
feeling of unwearied repose given by certain soft rich colors or by low
deep full tones or smooth yielding surfaces, is another form of organic
response which is often spoken of.</p>

<p>(11) The direction of the stimulus with respect to the normal position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
of the body also seems to have something to do with the regularity
of the response, and with the general forward or backward tendency.
Tactual surfaces applied or tones sounded behind the subject do
seem to make the bodily adjustment more confused, and less pleasant.
All that subjects could say was that the position was felt as abnormal
and correspondingly less pleasing.</p>

<p>(12) In many unpleasant feelings, where there was no specific
localization possible, the "stiffening tendency of hardening one's self to
a necessary experience" was frequently reported. In the case of other
states of undifferentiated pleasure a "consenting bending forward of
the whole body" was often detected.</p>

<p>(13) Many stimulations seem to demand that one draw one's self
erect, square the shoulders, and "assume the attitude of alertness."</p>

<p>(14) Certain colors for almost every subject independently hint at
sea-sickness. Others, as noted above, report the incipient suggestion
of nausea in the digestive tract. Indeed, abdominal references are
frequently reported by most of the subjects. The abdominal muscles
become "eased up," or again there is a "sucking-in of the belly."</p>

<p>(15) The feeling of "being natural," of regularity, a universally
popular feeling, is described as a pleasant relief from all tensions and
habitual inhibitions, or a dropping of one's characteristic muscular
tonicity.</p>

<p>(16) Other stimulations still, particularly certain delicate odors, for
men, subjects C and E for example, seem to suggest what they call the
"childish play impulse." They are called "simple, foolish, childish
pleasures," ignored in ordinary life. They are slightly pleasantly irritating,
and merely make one wish to do something. It is pure bodily
restlessness, a general kinÃ¦sthetic enjoyment. Three subjects, especially,
find here the frequent twitchings in the calves of the legs, in
the knee-cap, and the more decided innervations which contract the
tendons of the thighs and hips.</p>

<p>(17) Subject I frequently detected sensations of contraction in
the tensor tympani connected with the pleasure derived from high
tones. Others referred feelings for tones partly to the regions of the
ears.</p>

<p>(18) The kinds of facial references are numerous. General contraction
or expansion around the eyes, forehead, temples, sometimes
to the whole head, and quite frequently it seemed as if the feeling
referred to the very inside of the eyeball, to the iris and accommodation
movements.</p>

<p>(19) Subjects A, D, F, and K noted specific incipient tendencies to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
smile, to smooth the brow, and to "unbend the face" as characteristic
descriptions of certain oft-repeated experiences.</p>

<p>(20) Introspections from subjects F and G quite constantly
revealed articulatory impulses vividly accompanying the feelings for
many colors and forms.</p>

<p>(21) A scowl and puckering of the lips was descriptive of the attitude
taken toward some unpleasant situations.</p>

<p>(22) A contraction or relaxation of the throat-muscles and of the
vocal chords generally was not infrequently noticed. The tendency
to swallow is spoken of. The throat is felt often to be "concave" when
certain bad feelings are sufficiently pronounced. A contraction in the
mucous membrane, with teeth on edge, such as one would experience
in eating something sour, is frequent. A twitching of the ears, squinting
of the eyebrows, and a "heavy feeling" through the neck and chest
occur often, or again a pressing hard of the tongue against the roof of
the mouth.</p>

<p>(23) Forms suggested a shrinking in the volume of the face, sometimes
of the crown of the head, and even of the whole head.</p>

<p>(24) Upright or horizontal ovals especially provoked the impulse
to imitate the figure itself, either with the lips or with the hands and
arms. When the feeling was particularly strong, all these impulses
often occurred together and appeared mutually to reÃ«nforce, or to
intensify each other.</p>

<p>(25) Horizontal ovals gave one the feeling of being "flattened out,"
coupled with an impulse to adjustment altogether unlike the sprightly,
alert, airy feeling aroused by the "trim," upright figures.</p>

<p>(26) Occasionally when the irregular shapes were presented directly
after a subject had been enjoying one of the perfect figures, that side
of his face or body corresponding to the distorted portion of the figure
was felt to be in an abnormal and unpleasant position. This "caving-in"
or "bulging-out" sensation, which accompanies the unpleasant
feeling, happens when the whole muscular system at the time for the
subject seems inert or externally controlled.</p>

<p>All these sensations of bodily processes, taken from the introspective
descriptions given by the subjects, are distinctly reported by them
as very faint. They by no means detect them in every experience, nor
do they always seem to the subject himself to <em>mean</em> the whole of the
feeling as experienced. Neither did any one subject find all the concomitant
processes recorded above. Subject H failed throughout the
whole period to detect anything whatsoever, except slight tendencies
to frown, smooth the brow, or to open wide the eyes. This subject was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
unable to detect any special differences in his feelings, either in variety
or in amount. For him neither soft red nor brilliant yellow was either
exciting or soothing. They were and always remained for him more
or less vaguely pleasant, and this description for him was both ultimate
and exhaustive.</p>

<p>Subject B could get no kind of pleasant feeling from any tactual
surface, while to Subject E even the coarsest sandpaper usually
afforded pleasant stimulation. As spoken of above, articulatory
impulses were characteristic of the motor tendencies of Subjects D
and G. To Subject A the experiences seemed richest and fullest, and
the corresponding bodily processes were likewise more pronounced
and varied. In the great majority of the experiments, especially during
the period of training, the feeling itself vanished when the subjects
attempted to analyze the bodily processes. It was chiefly, however, a
matter of training, and this more and more ceased to be a disturbing
element.</p>

<p>Some subjects preferred often to speak of circulatory, or at least,
decidedly internal and usually involuntary changes in addition to,
and sometimes without, the controlled muscular actions. The mood
of the time affects the amount of feeling, and occasionally, but far less
frequently, the quality. The moral significance of the feelings was
most prominent when the subject felt most interested in the experiment,
as may be noted above in their descriptions of the feelings for
red and yellow. What may be termed the "<em>regularity element</em>" would
seem generally to serve as the test especially for the pleasant-unpleasant
character of the feeling-tone. The feeling of expansiveness
never accompanied unpleasant feelings. Feelings of contraction, on
the other hand, very often occurred when the feelings were not at all
disagreeable. In such cases there was a significance attached to
the direction or meaning of the adjustment.</p>


<h3>P<span class="smcapa">ART</span> II</h3>

<p><em>Section A.</em> Here simultaneous stimulations of different sense-organs
were given, and the situation became at once more complex. For some
time only colors and tactual surfaces were employed. Later tones from
tuning-forks and noises were added. Forms with different colors as
fillings still further complicated the experience. Odors as a rule were
unsatisfactory, being so strong as entirely to inhibit all noticeable
effects from the other senses.</p>

<p>For all subjects at first the feeling-tone related only to the one object<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
directly attended to. Some effort is required to detect the feeling-tone
for these slight stimulations, and while this is being done, the feeling
for the other sensation tends to vanish. If, while enjoying the soothing
contact with the plush, a chosen color is disclosed in the frame and
attended to sufficiently to obtain from it a decided feeling, there is
a distinct awareness of the dropping of the feeling for the touch. To
some subjects, whatever the combinations used, this almost constantly
occurred for perhaps a month. Often again there seemed to result
a total "feeling of the situation," when the attention was on neither
stimulating object.</p>

<p>Frequently, too, the attempted introspection at this point failed to
fix upon any feeling-tone at all definite. The condition was one of confusion
and bewilderment. The state of mind when one cannot feel at
all definitely seems to correspond closely to that state of mental confusion
when thought processes are in a jumble, with no path for the
moment leading anywhere. All these difficulties were overcome,
partially at any rate, by continued training. It was not as if introspection
revealed the fact that there was nothing to be found, and this
was frequently reported by the subjects. After some time the touch
character could be retained, and its peculiar value for feeling did not
disappear when other things came in and contributed an affective element
of their own. The old law of the opposition, or mutual exclusiveness,
of feelings would thus seem to mean little more than that we,
generally speaking, experience one thing at a time. Without a special
analytical purpose in view, we do not find many distinct elemental
feelings, as we do not, until we psychologize, find elements of cognitive
character separable. It has been, and is now, commonly supposed that
myriads of ideational elements, partially analyzable at any rate, go to
make up what we choose to call a single perception. This experience
as a whole is of some affective nature; but, as generally stated, of one
unanalyzable sort always. It is true just in the same sense as in the
cognitive state, perception. In the sense that every perception is
unique, in this sense every affective state is likewise a unit. The evidence
I submit, however, is that one may be the subject of analysis
into elemental parts just as much as the other. Affection, as Titchener
defines it at the beginning of his treatment of feelings, is merely a "tilt
of the whole organism." If this is the ultimate statement, then there
are no combinations, and no relations of feelings except that of mutual
exclusion from the field of awareness. He has taken only one of the
above possible attitudes toward affective states. Geiger, in his study
of very complex emotions, however, has taken the other attitude, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
bases his whole position upon it. This present experimental test
furnishes evidence that the latter position is also a legitimate, and
perhaps more desirable position, if feeling shall have scientific analytical
treatment.</p>

<p>In this investigation, after considerable training, the subjects, with
a single exception, <em>were all convinced that both feeling-tones, for tactual
and visual impressions, could be present at once</em>. When three or more
were given at once, confusion as to the state of feeling was usually so
great that valuable introspection was always rendered exceedingly
difficult. Impressions from the same field, as, for example, colors presented
in chosen forms as enclosures, were most often taken as one
object with one feeling-tone. This even was by no means always the
case. When it was thus taken, the experience was still reported as
more complex than either element alone had produced.</p>

<p>When the feeling-tones for simultaneous stimulations from two different
sources came out sufficiently clearly, the kind of feeling was
described in some such terms as indicated in Part I, Section A, except
that almost invariably the introspection was more difficult. The relations
of these various feeling-components of an affective experience are
numerous. There is a frequent tendency to read one into the other.
The soft soothing feeling coming from plush, if in the particular experience
the color be the more prominent partial element, tends often to
make the subject enjoy more the color, because there seems to be
added to it a soft yielding surface texture. Frequently also, as in the
case of red above, the warmth it suggests is intensified.</p>

<p>In cases of feelings of opposite nature occurring together, the
stronger generally prevails, finally in most cases effacing all specific
tone for the weaker element. An odor, for example, even when always
unpleasant, becomes less so when one looks at a pleasant color, when
a feeling-tone can, or often even when it cannot, be detected for the
color at the time. Again, when a very unpleasant form or tactual
impression is being felt, a slightly unpleasant color tends to arouse
often in this situation, as if by contrast, a simultaneously pleasant
element in the total experience.</p>

<p>For many subjects frequently there results what I shall call a "Total
Mood." This, as to its feeling-character, can be merely different from,
more than, less than, or the same as either component or of both together.
To some the feeling is proportionate to the degree of concentration
of attention, and in all such cases rarely does the whole complex
situation afford a feeling equal to that given by either component alone,
the extra stimulation for the time being simply a disturbing factor. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
others the shifting of the focus of attention from one to another of the
external objects of interest, or from one feeling-element to the other, is
not at all disturbing, "any more than is any general state of satisfied
self-contemplation." This kind of experience is often and distinctly
reported, not as the enjoyment of two where the discernible elements
persist wholly unrelated, but rather an enjoyment (or disagreeable
experience as the case may be), simply from two sources of stimulation,
a total mood with similar or harmonious constituents. The red color
and the tactual feeling for plush afford this. Similarly the unpleasant
color above combines with certain odors or with the sandpaper. Yellow,
however, does not as a rule produce a feeling that peaceably
"falls in with" the tactual impression brought about by the plush.
Low tones tend to combine thus with the red color or with the softest
plush in the same kind of Total Mood. The feeling-tones usually for
pleasant high tones are described as "falling in with" the feeling for
yellow when the feeling exists as described above, and as nearer to
that of the feeling for the green color than for the particular deep
shade of red. What may be termed the "<em>Congruity</em> or <em>Incongruity of
Feeling-Tones</em>" is perhaps a good name to designate feeling-tone relations.
It implies neither mutual exclusiveness nor total fusion, and
some such term is necessary.</p>

<p>The various phenomena of fusion, summation, partial reÃ«nforcement,
merely simultaneous, independent coexistence, partial and
total inhibition, of one by the other occur. The feeling-tone for yellow
tends most readily to fuse with the feeling-tone for high tones and
upright ovals. This is not so marked for the green, but more so for all
other colors than for the red. Red harmonizes and tends to fuse, for
most subjects, with the feeling-tones for soft plush, low tones, and
circular forms. This harmonizing, however, is not all that contributes
to the amount of feeling in these complex cases. Subjects often prefer
the low tones with yellow, even though there is less harmony. So also
upright ovals are in themselves generally so much more pleasant than
the circles that red is preferred thus presented, though its feeling-character
is more akin to that suggested by the circles. These are
cases where the intensity itself of the feeling-tone is preferred, even
though what is felt to be an harmonious combination is lessened.</p>

<p>When the situation admits of a complete fusion, the one resulting
feeling is almost always greater. When summation of unpleasant
stimuli occurs, the singleness of the attention process is not a prominent
feature of the experience. Rather each unpleasant element exists
throughout, each in turn intensifying the whole undertone of feeling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
but also remaining a feeling-tone of a particular kind. Partial reÃ«nforcement
is descriptive of that state when both feeling-tones contribute
to a feeling of the same kind, yet do retain some individual
characteristics which stand out for themselves. The general state of
pleasantness, for example, is increased by both elements contributed
by a low tone and the yellow color, yet one retains its soothing and the
other its exciting character. Again, the feeling-tone for green may
occur when its relation, on the other hand, to a pleasantly sounding
tuning-fork is not at all noticed. Subjects find in such cases always
more effort required to note both the feeling-tones, and there is probably
some diminution in quantity of feeling for each of the simultaneous
elements. Other subjects have preferred to call this partial inhibition.
Cases of total inhibition have been noted above, and are by far
the most frequent, as would naturally be expected. When sandpaper
is being applied, and no repose is felt in the body, a color, suddenly
presented, for a moment pleases the eye, but quickly loses all feeling-character,
and can only be "intellectually perceived."</p>

<p>Again, the way in which subjects will take certain combinations
seems to depend entirely upon the person. Beautiful colors, presented
in disagreeable forms, bring about for some a feeling altogether worse
than does an unpleasant color in the same form. To others there is
always the tendency to enjoy the color and to "reconstruct" the form,
or stress in it those elements only which do suggest symmetry and
definiteness. All feel, when two or more elements contribute to the
feeling-experience, that a total mood generally serves as the undertone
for them. When there is a clear strife between the two, they both
can exist as equal partial tones with an undertone of unpleasantness
in the failure to coÃ¶rdinate them. There are still other cases where
the total result cannot well be called a fusion or summation. For
example, when an unpleasant color in an unpleasant form, or for
Subject D, a pleasant color in an unpleasant form, is presented, the
feeling for the whole is often out of all proportion to the value of each
alone, or of what might be expected from the simple summation. The
uncommon revulsion here was frequently so striking that the subjects
would afterwards laugh heartily over the strength with which it first
appeared.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><em>Section B.</em> Introspection here as to the physiological accompaniments
referring exclusively to one of the two or more existing feeling-tones
is still more meagre, but at times very definite. When the elements
of a total feeling fuse there is of course no reference to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
particular processes which bring this about. It is then simply a general
response to a situation. <em>When, however, distinct, or opposing feeling-tones
are present and detected, they do often mean opposing inclinations
to action.</em> The yellow color can retain its exciting tone, and refer
clearly to such activities as opening wide the eyes, incipient smiling
tendencies, and general alertness of facial expression, when a soothing
touch is also felt as suggesting a toning-down of the body and a general
relaxation of the muscles of the abdomen. This is the most frequently
noticed effect.   Tactual impressions are accompanied by
pervading organic feelings in the trunk, while visual and auditory
stimulations, in their incipient stages, at least, have the more pronounced
effect upon facial muscles of expression, and general sensations
in the head. When any of these feelings are particularly strong,
however, the sensations, whose feeling-tones seem to constitute the
feeling in question, tend to pervade the entire system and to usurp the
whole bodily activity. The motor tendencies noticed above for the
irregular forms are also reported when the color itself remains pleasant.
Yellow, possessing more of this activity itself, is least pleasant when
exposed in these forms. The opposition of tendencies is noticed,
yellow meaning its own peculiar kind of aggressive movement, and the
bad form at the same time calling for that irregular kind of unpleasant
adjustment. Red does not "intrude itself" nor demand action,
and is always less strikingly in opposition to the form than is the case
with yellow or green or blue. Forms, almost perfect, relate themselves
to feelings of tension. One feels that he cannot quite take them as
perfect figures, and this strain and inability to take them for what
they suggest provokes a decidedly unpleasant feeling. Very irregular
forms become "grotesque" or ludicrous, and the bodily change is
indicated as a "jumble of partially carried out reactions."</p>

<p>In many cases sensations or motor tendencies are noted all over the
body during the existence of these complex states. At such times
they are not recognized as referring to either feeling-tone in particular.
When also a favorite color is presented to a subject who is experiencing
a disagreeable feeling from sandpaper, the touch is so pervasive
usually that he feels that this "controls the whole response" and
inhibits any reaction, or even any suggested reaction to the color.
When there does fail to be even any possible incipient motor suggestion,
as a rule the feeling-tone for the object is extremely vague if it
exists at all, and the object appears for the time "dead" or "valueless."
Subjects speak of their own inability to respond in such cases.
It is not at all as if the color is definitely bad, but rather as if one cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
do two different things with the same muscular apparatus at once.
As often, as has before been noted, does the opposite occur. Colors
in definitely characterized forms illustrate the relations of similar
activities when feeling-tones occur together. Yellow is preferred in
upright ovals, for both accentuate the same demand for activity, and
calling for the same kind of response, tend to fuse into a single object.
Yellow and plush do not harmonize, and in many cases where both
retain their feeling-tones, distinct activities in different parts of the
body are aroused simultaneously. With the circles the feeling-tone
for yellow does not agree with that for form. The yellow becomes
almost unpleasant at times. Circles are "heavy," "stable," "on their
own axes." A yellow thus enclosed seems "too fat," too "unnaturally
heavy," not free and light, and the effect is less pleasing. Circles suit
the red better than they do the yellow or the green or the blue, and
tend to be seen as one object, or to fuse, more readily than red in an
upright oval form. The feeling-tones for red and for upright ovals are
both very pleasant, but not as much in harmony, and consequently
usually taken as two different feelings.</p>

<p>As a general result of introspective analysis at this point, when different
feeling-tones did occur together, they were described in terms
similar to those used when each alone was experienced. The bodily
references, when found, were of the same character, the only difference
being that there was much difficulty in determining to which feeling-tone
the response referred. In many instances, however, again it
seemed quite certain that different kinds of adaptation in different
parts of the body were suggested which seemed to correspond to distinct
affective qualities. Also distinct feeling-tones, each of which
alone could call forth a similar kind of action, when given together
tended to accentuate the total unified response. The upright ovals
mean alertness and soaring motions with a general suggestion of
drawing the shoulders up. The yellow color accentuated this. The
circle with the soothing red, or the fusion of feelings for red and plush,
pleases in quite another fashion.</p>


<h3>P<span class="smcapa">ART</span> III</h3>

<p>In attempting to measure the rate at which feeling-tones for those
slight stimulations develop when no disturbing factors are consciously
present, an interval of from one and one half to two and one half
seconds seemed to be required. At such a time the feeling was experienced
as having reached its maximum. There was no marked difference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
for different subjects, nor any constantly noticeable difference among
the kind of stimulations used. A possible exception was found for
Subject I, but this was probably due, as he himself thought, to his
inability to adapt himself easily to the requirement of the experiment.</p>

<p>After this was sufficiently tested, the interval which was required
for one feeling-tone to arise when another was already present, was in
the same manner tested. The interval in all cases was too long to be
measured by means of a chronometer. A stop-watch was used.</p>

<p>While the subject was consciously enjoying a sound from a tuning-fork
or a tactual impression from some chosen texture surface, one of
the colors was presented to him. The time-interval thus ascertained
as necessary for the new feeling-tone to reach its maximum was compared
in each case with the time-interval when the color alone was
presented. Various combinations were here employed also. Colors
in forms in addition were studied in comparison with the same colors
presented without regard to the enclosing forms. No definite results
could be obtained in most cases. It was thought that the repose one
feels for plush might appreciably hasten the feeling-tone for the red
and probably retard that for the more exciting yellow. The evidence
is not directly conclusive. This was not found to be the case in much
more than half of the tests. It did, however, in the great majority of
the cases with all subjects, retard the time-interval for the development
of the unpleasant character of ordinarily disagreeable colors.
Given at such times also the normally unpleasant colors not infrequently
appeared themselves as slightly agreeable. In these cases the
interval was also appreciably longer, suggesting evidence that new
processes of some sort were set up. A pleasant low tone hastened the
arousal of a pleasant feeling-tone for red quite perceptibly for three
subjects, and had no influence upon the other subjects. The feeling-tone
for yellow under the same circumstances was for two subjects
retarded regularly, with no marked effect either way for the others.
The same low tone retarded all the unpleasant colors, as did the plush,
in many cases causing them to appear as pleasant.</p>

<p>The effect of forms, as enclosures for colors, upon the time-rate was
more marked and constant. Subject I again was always disturbed
when colors were presented to him in definite forms. For him feeling-tones
never arose so quickly when the form-element entered. For the
other six subjects, available for this part of the work, upright ovals
considerably increased the whole state of pleasure whether or not
fusion of the different elements resulted. For them the feeling-tone
for every pleasing color was hastened from two fifths to four fifths of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
a second. These same forms retarded the unpleasant colors whenever
one element of the experience seemed to be opposed to the other.
Occasionally here also the color appeared as itself directly and unaccountably
pleasant, the prepared situation of the subject being
such, apparently, that the ordinary character of the color did not
appear at all. This was very frequently the case for all subjects.</p>

<p>The irregular unpleasant forms generally retarded the feeling-tone
for the enclosed color when that color appeared to have lost some of
its accustomed agreeableness. When, however, the contrast in feeling-character
between the form-element and the color-element as such
was noted as marked, the feeling-character of the color was more
often hastened than retarded. These same forms in almost every case
(of nearly two months' work for seven subjects) hastened the feeling-tone
for the corresponding disagreeable color. Often again pleasant
colors changed the feeling-tones for these irregular forms. In such
cases the influence could not be attributed to the effect of unpleasant
forms upon feeling-tones.</p>

<p>Statistics alone seem insignificant here. Each variety of affective
experience in itself presents its own peculiar difficulties. In a great
number of tests the affective phases of the experiences were all described
in such terms as to suggest that too general a grouping of them
would not mean much. Often when one thought, after a careful
choice of the stimuli to be used, that the experiment would show that
feelings whose prominent characteristics were those of excitement or
tension, for example, were exerting an influence upon some other
kind of feeling, introspection would reveal the fact that altogether
other phases of the experience were the pronounced elements. Examples
of what at first appeared to be capricious results illustrate the
baffling nature of the problem here dealt with. Red is very pleasant.
The oval with the bulging side is repulsive. This combination caused
no marked retardation in the time required for a feeling-tone to develop.
The blue, not so markedly pleasant alone, with the same
bulging oval as its frame, had its feeling-tone changed, and the time-development
quite perceptibly hastened. This same blue color with
an upright oval as its frame produced a feeling-tone much more pleasant,
also with marked hastening of the speed-development of its
feeling-character. The pleasant-unpleasant dimension of the feeling
clearly cannot alone furnish one with an explanation of these different
phenomena. The red under normal conditions, <em>i. e.</em>, if not influenced
by either favorable or unfavorable coexisting feeling-tones, aroused
its peculiar and not necessarily pervasive kind of physiological process.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
Likewise all our evidence goes to show that the feeling for blue is
correlated with a peculiar physiological process, not so deeply seated
in the organism, and not so satisfactorily coÃ¶rdinated, or "definite."
Now the specific feeling-tone for forms arises when the imitative adjustment
called for is successfully accomplished. In the first combination
cited above the feeling-tone for red, being mild, soothing, more
pervasive than blue, but lacking in the exciting character, is correlated
with processes not so easily influenced by the reactions occasioned
by the presented forms. Subjects say that it does not call
for "surface reactions." It is less "intrusive." It does not "fall in
with," nor does it strikingly oppose, the necessary reaction to the
forms. Its influence upon the time-development of feeling-tones for
accompanying stimuli is consequently small. This is not the case with
the blue. The explanation, however, does not here differ in principle.
This "volatile, unstable, indecisive, thin, or shallow" feeling, can be
more easily influenced by the definite and decisive processes characteristic
of the forms. It, indeed, needs something to determine its
character, or coÃ¶rdinate its general reaction. Hence in both the above
combinations the development period of the new feeling-tone for blue
is shortened. The feeling reaches its maximum in either combination
more quickly than when it occurs alone. As one should expect, fusion
or mutual reÃ«nforcement quickens coÃ¶rdinated reaction; and partially
independent coexistence, except where the contrast is sharp, serves as
a condition for the lengthening of the latent period of feelings.</p>


<h3>P<span class="smcapa">ART</span> IV</h3>

<p>It is beyond the province of this paper to report the accounts the
subjects have attempted to give of the complex feelings aroused by
the pictures of statues. The primary and limited purpose is to try to
trace out the influences of the feelings before dealt with for colors when
these are also present in some way related to the now complex Ã¦sthetic
states. The <em>EinfÃ¼hlung</em>, often reported for the simple forms, is here
much more easily detected, if the statues arouse agreeable feelings.
They "work themselves into the statue," or assume the position, or
the facial expression if this is prominent, or feel very strongly in their
own body what seems to be the most prominent element in the feeling
portrayed by the figure. Few subjects liked all the statues. Incipient
if not actual tendencies to motion of some sort, with the sensory counterparts
to these situations called for when the subject feels that he is in
the "proper attitude" to get most feeling from the presentations,
chiefly constitute what was in different ways reported.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>These statues presented on colors as backgrounds are variously
and interestingly modified. The feeling-tones for colors distinctly
affect the meaning of the statues. Of the above colors our shade of
red is preferred with Venus by all subjects. Here the feeling-tones
more nearly fuse. Always the feeling-character of the statue predominates,
and the other feeling-elements of the situation are accepted
or rejected in proportion as they harmonize or fail to harmonize
with the predominant partial tone. Red, for example, here adds to the
"richness and luxuriousness." It accentuates the strength, poise,
grace, balance, ease, rest, wisdom, composure, endurance, and dignity.
It is more soothing, and calls for no unnecessary action. One subject
never liked any color as a background. In this case colors were good
in proportion as "they kept out of the way." This is the reason for red
being always preferred to yellow or green. With these latter colors
there is an interplay of reactions not coÃ¶perating. The color-exciting
element is more immediate, tension is brought about, the color asserts
itself, is pleasant, and tends directly to inhibit the feelings for the
statue. The pleasure in the color is called "thin" in comparison, and
the power of sympathetic appreciation of Venus is lessened. There
is suggestion now in the statue still of its strength, but with no "enduring"
quality. It has become commonplace, merely a "pretty
woman," jaunty, self-sufficient, cynical, and with little dignity. The
motion element, now prominent, is not pertinent. The statue looks
"cheap," and as a figure is volatile and unsteady.</p>

<p>In a similar way one finds these feeling-tones for colors variously
playing their part. The statue of Apollo is not pleasing to some subjects.
They want it "toned down." The red effects this. To some it
is most pleasing by its suggestion of easy grace and springy, elastic
step. The yellow harmonizes and accentuates this chosen feeling. The
blue often destroys its moral meaning. The red hampers the feeling
for the <em>LaocoÃ¶n</em> group. They become listless, dead, and have still
strength, but no struggle. Yellow increases the amount of activity,
but often lessens the "serious despair." Fierceness is added, but the
liveliness thus furnished is at the expense of the necessary balancing
solemnity. The color again becomes intrusive. "The snakes fairly
dance," and the "flashing action behind" the statue is now too
prominent.</p>

<p>For the <em>Dying Gladiator</em> or <em>Dying Alexander</em> red is preferred. It,
however, as do all the other colors, often produces an overbalance in
the whole situation. Here it suggests no conflicting feelings. It adds&mdash;often
too much&mdash;to the hopelessness of the situation, and gives to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
them an exaggerated solemnity and resignation, which emphasizes a
melancholy cast, not altogether called for. Green and yellow are
always incongruous. They tend to distract the attention to certain
particular muscles, thereby lessening the whole general effect. The
little "prettiness" they still retain is not called for, and is not "of the
right sort." They do not allow one to be sufficiently contemplative or
thoughtful. They have little depth, and cause inharmonious bodily
commotions, and too much intensify the life-struggle and anguish.</p>

<p>The general effect of the statues here is much like that of the simple
forms above. Both not only call for something to be done by the subject,
but some action more or less already definitely outlined. The
EinfÃ¼hlung for little wooden figures, such as cones, columns, pyramids,
etc., was clear and decided. The tipping character or the
straight erectness caused a feeling which seemed describable in terms
of the way in which the bodily position, as one naturally adapted himself
to the object, took place. Statues afford richer experiences, but the
principle is not different. They seem full of suggestions of abstractions,
such as strength, wisdom, grace, beauty, power, and, in general, what
are often called spiritual feelings. These are not so easily imitated in
detail. Subjects have their own ways of adapting themselves. They
want to carry out the suggestion or impulse in their own way. These
impulses are projected into the figure, and all of the vigor inhibited
in one's own body becomes a living part of the figure. The impulses
thus from the colors may or may not be of such a character as to bring
about the same proportionate adjustment as a desirable intensification
equally of all the feeling-elements. Whether desirable or not,
however, these feeling-combinations furnish additional illustrations of
the various mutual relations of coexisting feelings.</p>

<p>The <em>Angelus</em> or the <em>Shepherdess Knitting</em> bring about feelings in
striking contrast to the feeling for the <em>Horse Fair</em> picture. The latter
arouses suggestions of a tumultuous bodily condition, increased muscular
tonicity, muscles twitching everywhere, breathing heavier,
shoulders strained, and in comparison, great general innervation.
When the characteristic feeling had been aroused, the subjects were
requested to close their eyes and observe if possible to what extent
the feeling already aroused was dependent upon the retained images.
The results were clear. If the feeling is slight, as it is for some subjects,
the feeling tended to vanish and return with the recurring
images. If it is fairly strong, the feeling persists for some time after
visual imagery is lost. If very strong, the feeling is constant for a still
longer period and still less dependent upon the original peripheral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
excitation. The feeling is always more constant than any imagery.
Not often for example is the whole picture retained. Sometimes one
prominent part only remains. Often again various kinds of imagery
aid in preserving the feeling. Besides visual, auditory, the sounds of
the horses' hoofs, of the tones of the Angelus bell, are chiefly prominent
in preserving the situation and the condition for the feeling.
Articulatory impulses again, in the tendency to repeat to one's self such
words as are descriptive of the moral meaning of the pictures, offer
sufficient clues to keep the desired feeling aroused. When the feeling
has "struck deep," subjects report motor imagery pervading the whole
system. In such cases the recurring visual imagery has little effect
upon the feeling. On the whole, the feelings for the more quiet pictures
last longer and are more easily retained than is the case with the
more exciting ones, if the original feelings are, as to mere intensity,
approximately equal.</p>

<p>The character and strength of these feeling-tones determine also to
a large extent the lines of association followed. Here the mutual influences
of feelings are clearly recognized. The character of the new
associated images and situations is colored by the feelings which were
connected with the original stimulations. The pictures, such, for
example, as the <em>Angelus</em> and the <em>Horse Fair</em>, were presented to the
subjects in quick succession. These were to be merely starting-points
for association. For all the subjects who were able to report anything
definite, the feeling-tone for one was read into the associations which
were aroused by the other. The second of the two starting-points as
a rule controls the imagery. A few examples will illustrate how both
feeling-tones are retained. The <em>Angelus</em> was presented first in these
cases, and the <em>Horse Fair</em> second.</p>

<p>For subject K, the parts of the picture of the <em>Horse Fair</em> remained.
The feeling of seriousness and quietness, foreign to it itself, was projected
into it. Solemnity and the feeling of strength and power was
accentuated. The gaiety originally present was very much lessened,
and finally not noticed at all.</p>

<p>For subject C, a sacred feeling was aroused. Wars of the Bible
were recalled. There was a fusion of the imagery. He saw the church
on a battlefield near a cavalry fight. The feeling of active earnestness
and the sacred moral character was reported as due to the retained
feeling first brought about by the <em>Angelus</em>. The influence of the other
starting-point is clear.</p>

<p>Subject B found the incongruity between the two feelings very
strong. The <em>Angelus</em> was the stronger in influence. The other caused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
one to stress the lighter, more trivial character of the former. Meadows,
streams, pools, and enchanted regions typified the fanciful mood
thus brought about.</p>

<p>It is not a question as to whether such trains of thought would have
occurred if only one starting-point had been used. It is rather that,
in such cases as the above, two distinct feeling-tones were actually
detected as playing their part in the resulting complex experiences. It
is with some effort that both feeling-tones can be thus at first retained.
The resulting undertone or general mood, however brought about,
colors and determines to a certain extent the associations which follow.
The feeling is more deeply seated than the image, and here also it is
retained longer.</p>

<p>The above recorded account of the behavior of simple feelings fairly
represents the accumulated data at our disposal. How they can be
adjusted to modern theories of the relation of consciousness to movement
may be briefly suggested. Yet the rudimentary state both
of the psychology and of the physiology of feeling makes the present
task a hazardous one. Psychologists are not agreed as to the best
way to conceive of the relation of feelings to sensations. Feeling-tone
is in some ways dependent upon sensations; and at the same time,
in comparison with other sensation attributes, it is relatively independent.
Physiologists are still farther from agreement with regard
to the nervous processes involved.</p>

<p>But the <em>deeply organic seat</em> of feelings is unquestioned. However the
concept of feeling itself may differ, all are looking for corresponding
bodily processes by means of which to classify these affective states.
Clearly, to say that feeling is of such a nature that one need never hope
to be able to predict it from psycho-physical conditions, is no more
justified than to say that we can never predict exactly the intensity nor
the vividness of any stimulation. Feeling-tone is here simply on a par
with other attributes ascribed to sensation.</p>

<p>According to MÃ¼nsterberg's Action Theory the intensity of the
sensation depends upon the strength of the incoming current. Its
quality depends upon the position or location of this current in its
particular neurone. The vividness depends upon the "openness" or
"closedness" of the neurone conditioning the <em>outgoing current</em>. And
finally to the feeling-tone shall correspond the local difference of this
discharge in outgoing currents. For instance, the pleasant feelings
have, related to them, central outgoing paths which lead to approach,
and thus to the continuation of the stimulus, and the unpleasant
feelings have related to them in turn central neurones which lead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
to withdrawal or escape, and thus to the breaking-up of the stimulus.</p>

<p>Our empirical data gathered from the experiments above reported
demand not so much a modification as an elaboration of this theory.
The <em>tridimensionality</em> of the feeling-tone itself must be physiologically
described. We must conceive the feeling-tone itself as possessed of its
own vividness, intensity, and quality.</p>

<p>It seems clear indeed that any explanation of the affective or feeling-character
of experience must be sought somewhere in the outgoing
currents from the motor region. This alone will serve to account for
the inevitable volitional or "intent" aspect which invariably accompanies
feeling, and I think may serve to account also for the organic
or necessarily coÃ¶rdinating or functioning aspect required by some
writers who so stoutly object to "barren atomistic or structural"
psychological explanations.</p>

<p>The Action Theory might then be specialized in the following way:</p>

<p>The <em>intensity</em> of the feeling will depend upon the force or amount
of the outgoing currents from the motor cells. This would enable one
to explain that state of mind when a sensation only is experienced
from a stimulus which ordinarily has a characteristic feeling-tone, but
which feeling-tone in the special instance is lacking. Many cases have
been cited above where one feeling seemed to efface another. The
nerve-energy called for in arousing the unpleasant feeling-tone for the
sandpaper inhibited the process of the discharge from the cells conditioning
any response to the ordinarily pleasing red color. Others
again can reÃ«nforce or at least not seriously interfere with each other.
All cases already cited where two feeling-tones were detected as existing
simultaneously are examples in point. It is quite clear of course
that the intensity of feeling is not at all commensurate with the intensity
of sensation. Commotion is not the only condition for emotion.
Yet where there is no tendency to <em>do</em> anything, as is so noticeable in
the reported introspections above, there is no feeling. A mere shock,
even though intense as a sensation, simply benumbs one. In thus
describing any feeling for a particular stimulation, one should include,
besides the original results of the chosen peripheral excitation, all the
reÃ«nforcing factors that accumulate by reason of the sensory counterparts
to this originally called-for movement. When one is, for example,
feeling sandpaper, the feeling for the soft red, when it exists at all, is
less intense. Subjects say, "It ought to be more pleasant than it is.
The trouble is in me, not in the color." The suggested movement
which conditions the intensity is lessened in amount, or partially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
inhibited. One could scarcely say, so far as the sensation is concerned,
that it has lost some of its brightness, or that it is not strong enough
to arouse its customary feeling-tone. This is distinctly reported as not
the case. It is of course almost always recognized as the same shade
of color. The recorded examples, showing that intensity of feeling is
itself one dimension of a feeling-tone in no way necessarily related to
the intensity of the sensation, are numerous.</p>

<p>The <em>vividness</em> of the feeling-tone is likewise a relatively independent
phenomenon, and it, too, is not commensurate with the vividness of
the sensation as such, and hence demands a different explanation. It
can then be dependent upon the <em>actual stage in the process of completing
the movements suggested</em> by the color or tone or form in question. All
feelings dealt with in this investigation one can describe by relating
them to the actual stage in the process of completing the <em>coÃ¶rdinated
adjustments</em>. Without some progress in such a process no feeling would
cross the threshold of awareness. In Part III above are recorded many
illustrations, where <em>degrees of vividness</em> for feelings are noted by the
subjects. When they were attempting to report the actual time when
a feeling became definite enough to be called such at all, there was
much difficulty in knowing just when to give the signal. Feelings
develop much more slowly than do perceptions. Subjects often give
the signal too soon, at once correcting themselves by saying that it was
too vague at that moment. It grows in definiteness, and has degrees
of vividness. A movement in the first stages of the process, before the
feeling-tone has sufficiently developed, is a state of vague feeling.
Again, many states of so-called indifferent feeling meant, according to
the subjects, not lack of feeling, but rather vagueness, lack of vividness.
Three or more stimulations from different sources resulted in
confusion where no feelings were vivid. When the color again, for
example, is pronounced "dead" so far as feeling is concerned, other
feelings and other movements are too prominent. The sensations are
in such cases unchanged. The intensity and vividness of the feeling-tone
for the color are at a minimum.</p>

<p>And thirdly the <em>quality</em> of the feeling-tone must be dependent upon,
and must be described in terms of the particular kind of coÃ¶rdinated
movements suggested or actually carried out. Thus the characters
of the feeling-tones for the yellow color above described, for the upright
ovals, for the very high tones, for the <em>LaocoÃ¶n</em> group, and for the
<em>Horse Fair</em>, are in some respects alike. They have the same general
<em>GefÃ¼hlsgrundlage</em>. The qualities of the feelings for soft deep red, for
tactual plush, for low tones, and for the <em>Angelus</em>, and, for most subjects,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
for Venus, would represent another class having the same
<em>GefÃ¼hlsgrundlage</em>. This admits of all the uniqueness specific feelings
may have, and at the same time permits of a general classification
and description. Some subjects, D and F, for example, may have a
feeling whose quality is disgust at some color-form combination. The
accompanying sensations may be localized, as they frequently are, in
the arms, with impulses to "ward off" the displeasing influence.
Subject B often for the same feeling finds sensations of contraction
in the throat most prominent, and subject A a stiffening of the
features and incipient scowl. The most prominent localization depends
upon the habits of the person and the habitual kind of reaction
he has acquired and developed during his lifetime. The localization
of muscular activity may differ, but <em>the kind of coÃ¶rdination does not,
so far as our introspection shows</em>. The <em>regularity</em>, the <em>rate</em>, the <em>smooth
light ease</em>, or the <em>heavy, ponderous, deep-seated character</em> of the suggested
responses indicate some of the terms which would serve as
aids in classifying kinds of processes which are physiological conditions
for feelings of definite character. Again, feelings of pleasant repose,
of depression, or of sudden collapse are still changes also in innervation
tonus. These are adaptations for situations just as are the more
positive or aggressive kinds illustrated above. Feelings where quick
collapse occurs differ in <em>quality</em> from feelings of calm repose. All can
be conceived as kinds of adaptations or responses, and clearly correspond
to the characters of feeling-tones rather than to any other
dimension of feelings or sensations.</p>

<p>Certainly the central preparedness for discharge largely determines
the feelings. The external excitations are merely the clues. The internal
apparatus is set vibrating in a constant manner if no other external
or central stimulus is present to demand other adjustments or to intensify
the same kind. When such synergetic or antagonistic stimuli
are also present the mutual influences of feelings do seem to be, indeed,
of great significance.</p>

<h2>THE ÃSTHETICS OF REPEATED SPACE FORMS</h2>

<p class="p1b">BY ELEANOR HARRIS ROWLAND</p>


<h3>P<span class="smcapa">ART</span> I</h3>

<p>The object of this paper is to discover some of the sources of our
pleasure in repeated space forms, and the laws which govern this
repetition. The repetition of an object, and its regular recurrence
subject to certain possible variations, is one of the basal principles
of art, and of architecture in particular.</p>

<p>It is necessary at the outset to define our use of the word <em>repetition</em>
more exactly, for there are obviously different meanings of the
word, which may lead to confusion.</p>

<p>1. The term repetition may be applied to the existence of any
two objects similar to each other, whether they are near together
or widely sundered. Our pleasure in such a repetition would be
merely that of re-seeing and recognizing the two as counterparts of
each other. This kind of repetition I call <em>conceptual</em>, for it requires
only that the memory-picture of the object be held in mind and
the two recognized as similar when met again. This is not the
kind of repetition which I have in mind, and I shall never use the
word in this sense during the discussion.</p>

<p>2. In any one work of art there may be some feature repeated,
some motif which is taken up and carried out in different ways
throughout the whole, and these features we recognize as having
an orderly relation to one another in the unity. This might be termed
repetition of <em>content</em>, and be applied to the recurrence of some type
of decoration over a window or a peculiar arch taken up in various
ways throughout a cathedral. I do not use the word in this sense,
but limit it still further.</p>

<p>3. By <em>repetition</em> is meant during this discussion the regular recurrence
of an object, and an equally regular recurrence of intervals.
The repeated object must come at uniform intervals, and this restricts
us to the consideration of that repetition alone which consists
of recurrence at regular intervals of some object more or less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
beautiful in itself, and the description of the nature of our Ã¦sthetic
feeling in experiencing such a series.</p>

<p>Although this discussion is divided into the two divisions of <em>experiments</em>
and <em>analysis</em> of architectural examples, and the experiments
are described first, the investigation was not carried out separately
in this order. The two went along together, the art-analysis suggesting
experiments, and the experiments in turn throwing light on the
analysis. The two parts of the discussion are kept separate merely
for the convenience of the reader, and in the experimental discussion
all allusions to the art-illustrations are excluded in order to avoid
confusion. In reality the two went hand in hand, but the connection
between the experiments and art-analysis will be reserved for the
latter half of the paper.</p>

<p>The experiments were begun in the following manner: In a velvet
screen about a foot high was cut a window 460 mm. by 35 mm.
in size. Behind the window was a metre measure and a rod from
which hung small strips of cardboard 10 mm. wide. First two, three,
and four strips were hung behind the window, and the subjects
were required to arrange them at the intervals where they preferred
to see them repeated. The results were uniform in certain particulars
and very suggestive. In their arrangements of two, three and four
strips, the subjects were guided by considerations of symmetry or
proportion. They insisted that although they knew that the strips
were repeated, they did not feel the repetition, but the strips seemed
like parts of some larger unity to be arranged with reference to the
unity of the whole. With the addition of the fifth strip came a
difference in their apperception. Instead of the strips seeming parts
of a whole including figure they seemed like repeated units.</p>

<p>It will be seen, from the table, that with two exceptions they preferred
five strips equally distant from one another, while with four
strips, four subjects had preferred a symmetrical arrangement.
These gave as their reason that with five strips the latter appeared
more definitely to be repetitions of one another, while the four strips
seemed more like parts of a whole which required symmetry in its
arrangement. Moreover the two subjects who preferred five strips in
symmetrical arrangement instead of at equal distances affirmed that
a distinct feeling of repetition came with five strips that had not been
felt before, only they did not enjoy this feeling of repetition as well
as one of symmetry. After having seen the five strips, some subjects
could feel the repetition with four strips, but none with three.
The question naturally arose, what is this <em>feeling</em> of repetition which
makes one say that four or five repeated objects deserve the name,
while three or less are regarded in a different light? The analogy between
the apperception of this visual repetition and auditory rhythm
seemed so strong as to deserve attention.</p>

<p>In auditory rhythm it is necessary that there be recurrence of
more than two elements; they must come at a certain rate and within
a certain temporal space to seem connected with each other, and
they may be subjectively grouped in different ways. The apperception
of both kinds of repetition had so many analogies as to suggest
that some of the factors in both experiences were identical.</p>

<p>To focus the problem I took a definite thesis in regard to it. Our
apperception of repeated space forms is due to the rhythm of our
own motor adjustments which are excited in face of repetition,
harmoniously if they accord with certain rhythmic laws in us, inharmoniously
if they do not. It was then necessary to find what
facts would support such a thesis, to see if in reality such facts could
be marshalled, and if the explanation and support they offered was
conclusive enough to make it needless to look farther.</p>

<p>It would seem, if our pleasure in repetition depended on temporal
motor responses in us, that if the amount of time normally
taken to traverse a repeated series were shortened, or if the eyes
were fixed and not allowed to move over the field at all, our
enjoyment would cease altogether, or at least be seriously diminished.
If we found it impossible to enjoy the series except when
seen for a certain time, long enough for the eyes to go over it in the
rhythm peculiar to each subject, we should then conclude that our
enjoyment did depend, to some extent, on such temporal rhythm.</p>

<p>I experimented on this question with nine subjects, and the results<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
brought out different ways of apperceiving repetition, which
divided the observers into two rather well-marked types.</p>

<p>The apparatus was of the simplest, consisting of white silk strings
hung on a wire against a black background across one side of the
room. The strings were attached to the wire by little hooks, which
enabled one to change their position easily, while a cloth hid the
weights on the ends of the strings, so that nothing but the vertical
white lines were visible.</p>

<p>Fifty strings (50 mm. apart) were hung before the subjects, and
they were asked to survey the field and give a signal as soon as the
experience became pleasant. Then having found the average length
of time for each subject to enjoy these simple repetitions, a shorter
period was given when they were to shut their eyes at a given signal,
and see if in that shortened time they were still able to enjoy the
series. Next they fixated the eyes and kept the whole body rigid,
to see if pleasure was still possible when all outward motor response
was checked, so far as possible.</p>

<p>The results of this experiment were very suggestive. Of nine
subjects, all felt pleasure when allowed to move the eyes over the
series at random; with eyes fixed, five felt their pleasure much
altered in its quality as well as lessened, while with one it was altogether
destroyed. With four, however, although there was considerable
alteration in the quality of the pleasure, its amount was increased
rather than lessened.</p>

<blockquote><p>B. (1) Average time necessary to enjoy the series: 4.7 seconds.<br />
<span class="mleft1b">(2) Three-second exposure. No pleasure, needs more time during the movement.</span><br />
<span class="mleft1b">(3) Eyes fixed: 4 secs. = Av. time necessary to enjoy it. Lines bunch toward centre and fade away at sides, giving a kind of unity, but he feels constraint.</span></p>

<p>R. (1) Av. time: 4.3. Sees them in pairs.<br />
<span class="mleft1b">(2) Two-sec. exposure. Very faint pleasure; feels that only a part is perceived.</span><br />
<span class="mleft1b">(3) Eyes fixed: 4.3. One pair fixated, the others fade away, making a kind of figure. Pleasure faint and constrained.</span></p>

<p>L. (1) Av. time: 2.1.<br />
<span class="mleft1b">(2) 1-sec. exposure. Pleasure faint and incomplete. He feels the pleasure comes from memory of the previous experience.</span><br />
<span class="mleft1b">(3) Eyes fixed: 2.2. Great effort to find any pleasure. It consists mainly in seeing a few strings, and feeling there are others, even though they are not distinguished.</span></p>

<p>V. (1) Av. time: 2.2. Sees them in pairs.<br />
<span class="mleft1b">(2) 1.5-sec. exposure. Enjoys the experience in memory after the eyes are shut again.</span><br />
<span class="mleft1b">(3) Eyes fixed: 1.9. Still sees them in pairs, but cannot see enough of them, hence they are less pleasant.</span></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>W. (1) Av. time: 4.3.<br />
<span class="mleft1b">(2) 2-sec. exposure. Not enough time to feel any relation between the strings, most of the pleasure supplied by the memory.</span><br />
<span class="mleft1b">(3) Eyes fixed: 5.3. Pleasure is very faint, and consists in having the strings appear to converge to a central point, and fade at the sides.</span></p>

<p>J. (1) Av. time: 2.3. Sees them in pairs.<br />
<span class="mleft1b">(2) 1.5 exposure. Less pleasant.</span><br />
<span class="mleft1b">(3) Eyes fixed: 2.7. Series seems more like a unity and he enjoys it more, since no time is spent in exploring the field, but it is one unified experience.</span></p>

<p>U. (1) Av. time: 28. Only enjoys it by ignoring all except those in the centre&mdash;does not want so many.<br />
<span class="mleft1b">(3) Eyes fixed: 18 secs. Enjoys it when eye lights on one string, so that the others can fade away equally at the sides, in one figure.</span></p>

<p>S. (1) Av. time: 5.<br />
<span class="mleft1b">(2) 3-sec. exposure. Less pleasant.</span><br />
<span class="mleft1b">(3) Eyes fixed: 8.8. Pleasure consists in converging of lines toward central point. It appears like one figure and is more intense than (1).</span></p>

<p>H. (1) Av. time: 9. Sees them in pairs.<br />
<span class="mleft1b">(2) 1 sec. Just as pleasant as before.</span><br />
<span class="mleft1b">(3) Eyes fixed: 4.6. Pleasure in unity of whole series with centre of fixation emphasized. Only felt pleasure anyhow when the eyes had stopped moving,
so now it comes all the sooner.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>From these introspections it is obvious that there are two distinct
ways of apperceiving repetition: One in which the rhythmic
element is pronounced, so that when the time necessary for such
a rhythm is shortened, or by fixating the eyes the motor response
is hindered, the pleasure in the repetition is either altered or destroyed
altogether. The other type takes a repeated series in the
sense of a unified presentation and wants it all at once in a symmetrical
whole. The rhythmic factor is present in both, as is shown
by the fact that the quality of the pleasure was changed in every
case when the time of exposure was shortened. But in the latter
type of subject the pleasure felt in the presentation of the whole at
once, and the feeling of symmetry around a middle point, are more
intense than a rhythmic apperception. These two kinds of apperception
remain fairly constant throughout the experiments, and
for convenience' sake we shall call them spatial and temporal types.
With the former, the value of the experience consists especially in
having a central fixation-point from which the repeated elements
fade away equally on the sides, making a symmetrical whole. With
the temporal type, the pleasure is felt by means of the rhythmical
passage from one element of the series to the other. In passing from
point to point the rest of the field still remains in indirect vision,
so to the distinctly temporal a distinctly spatial factor is also present.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
For this reason the temporal type of apperception is the richer
of the two, and a description of it comes more nearly to the essence
of repetition as such.</p>

<p>Up to this time, the repeated element had always been a single
string. This was varied and the strings hung in pairs (50 mm. wide,
100 mm. between pairs). When the strings had hung at equal distances
from each other, six out of the nine subjects had seen them
in pairs while enjoying them, and had found such grouping more
or less essential to enjoyment. In seven cases the pleasure was increased
by this grouping. They expressed their preference in various
ways: "Easier to keep track of where we are going." "Can
go quicker over field, for repetitions are more well-marked." "Single
line is too thin to rest on, this gives broader space for repose."
All these introspections instanced the necessity of the rhythm being
marked and made plain, so that there should be no confusion of
point with point. The two who disliked this grouping were of the
spatial type, who found no pleasure in traversing the field, hence too
little content in it, in this arrangement, at any one time. Grouping
of some kind would seem to faciliate the apperception to a certain
class of subjects, while with others the amount and quality of the
content of the field is of more consequence.</p>

<p>Since accents are such an important factor of auditory rhythm,
the next experiment was to see if the apperception of a series of
repeated elements would be facilitated by accenting every other
one.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img  src="images/i_198.jpg" alt="Fig 1" />
</div>

<p>Another string was hung in every other pair thus making it more
striking, but here came a difference between the feeling of accent
in auditory and visual rhythms. The subjects declared the pairs
in which a third line was hung were not intensified alone, as when
a greater stress is put on a tone in auditory rhythm, but the pairs
were changed qualitatively. The group of three became the repeated
element, while the pair was only an alternating figure different
from the principal unit. This unanimous testimony brought up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
a variety of questions. 1. Is any purely <em>intensive</em> accent, without
involving qualitative changes, possible in visual repetition? 2.
What factor makes us choose one object rather than another as
the repeated element? 3. What is the value of the alternating figure
in such a series? 4. What is the value of the empty space between
repeated figures, and does it have as distinct a value as an alternating
figure? 5. Are all the recurring objects and spaces felt as
separate repetitions; if so, how many can be carried on at once?</p>

<p>These questions were put to the subjects in regard to the series
just described with considerable uniformity of answer.</p>

<p>(1) No such thing as purely stress accent seemed possible. The
word, signifying greater intensity without change of quality, did
not apply. If one attempted to <em>intensify</em> the repeated object in any
way, either hanging another string, thickening the strings, or any
similar device, it ceased to be the old unit but became a new one,
whose repetition was followed for its own sake, while the weaker
one retired into the background, and was not <em>felt</em> as the element
repeated in the series.</p>

<p>(2) Any regular change of the element which made it more interesting
or caught the attention, fixed it as the chosen unit of the
series, whose repetition was followed.</p>

<p>(3) Concerning the exact <em>value</em> of the alternating figure in the
series, there was great difficulty in introspection. They all "<em>knew</em>
the alternate figure was just as truly repeated as the principal one,
but could not feel it so." The three-group formed the unit of the
repeated series, and although the pair was clearly part of the experience
and distinctly perceived, for some reason it was not felt as
repeated in the same way as the other. It was merely an alternate,
a filling, which was essential to the other, but which had no significance
in itself as a repeated thing. Two subjects were able (if they
tried) to carry both repetitions along together, <em>i. e.</em>, not only feel the
three-groups as coming at regular distances from each other, but
the pairs as forming another interlacing series. This kind of apperception
was very fatiguing, however, and they could not enjoy it.
For any pleasure to be derived, the pairs must retire into the background,
and attention be fastened on the three-group.</p>

<p>(4) If the alternating figure was to be so subordinate, was there
any difference between its significance, and that of an empty space?
This was everywhere answered in the same way. The alternating,
or minor figure, had a very distinct value, and any irregularity in
it was even more irritating than in the principal unit itself. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
the space was empty they thought nothing of it, the equality of the
interspacing was taken for granted; while if they felt an irregularity
in it, it destroyed their pleasure in the whole series. But there
was no feeling for the empty space until its regularity had been violated,
while there was a distinctly pleasant factor in the minor
figure, even though different in quality from the principal element.</p>

<p>In the foregoing experiment the differences between the spatial
and temporal type of observer were still strongly marked. The former
type invariably grouped the elements (usually with the three-group
in the centre and a pair on each side) and they took their
pleasure in the symmetry of each figure so made, moving from the
centre of one to the centre of the next adjacent. In this method of
apperception there was no empty space between repetitions, for the
whole group of three figures was taken as the repeated unit. The
empty or rest-phase was gotten in moving from the centre of one
to the next, in which passage the limiting pair was ignored. One
spatial subject, finding the proportions of this artificial grouping
poor, got no enjoyment at all.</p>

<p>With the temporal type, the experience was quite different. They
moved across the field with the three-group as their stopping-points.
These principal elements were what they looked for, and their pleasure
seemed to consist in expecting and meeting it. What part the
<em>pair</em> played, they had difficulty in analyzing. Some said that while
the three-groups occupied most of their attention, they gave a lesser
degree to the pair, so that the rhythm of the passage across was
marked by heavier and lighter beats. Another found the figure in
the alternate space only an obstacle, and felt he was hindered in
the passage from unit to unit, the only compensation being, that
the "hindrance" came at regular distances. Others felt that two
repetitions were actually being carried on at once. By this they
meant that the two sets of elements were kept distinct, although
objectively combined, but the repetition of the pair was subordinate
in interest to that of the three-groups.</p>

<p>I tested the same thing (accents or major elements, and the value
of the alternating minor elements) by simply doubling every other
string of the series 50 mm. apart. In every case the effect was
found poor. It was "confusing," "too much work." They all felt
adjusted to the repetition of the double string and then encountered
the single one, which hindered them, and by trying to keep
both elements going at once they were fatigued. Most of them had
a distinct feeling that they wanted to swing from one element to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
the next, and were baffled by the alternate. In this arrangement,
even members of the spatial type who had not been able to get any
rhythmic feeling before, felt the movement in the series as if they
were going across, although they went (in two cases) in groups instead
of single elements. They all, however, felt the single string
as an obstacle which hindered their enjoyment, whether the double
string or a group was taken as element. This suggested the question:
What makes the difference between the minor figure being
an enrichment to the experience and being a hindrance? They insisted
some rest-period was necessary; some really empty space between
the repeated units, and when in place of rest they had more
to do, it spoilt the pleasure.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img  src="images/i_201.jpg" alt="Fig 2" />
</div>

<p>Next, two strings were hung at equal distances between the double
strings, and the latter put 100 mm. instead of 50 mm. apart. This
was liked better in every case, and the reasons given were much alike.
The double string was still the repeated unit, while the two strings
between did not <em>feel</em> repeated. In spite of the obvious inconsistency
of the statement that they did not <em>feel</em> the alternates to be repeated
even when they knew that they were so, just as much as the double
string, several subjects made the same remark. V. felt the series as
a rhythm, where the double strings were all he was interested in,
although he knew he should notice if the others were changed. B.
could not detect that they were of any importance, except as he imagined
them absent. B. could feel either the double strings or the
two strings between them as the major unit, only, whichever one
he took, the other retired into obscurity. He felt the minor units<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
in a different way as being repeated together with the majors, but
very weakly, and not at all unless he previously considered that he
ought to do so. L. said his attention was fastened on the double
strings, but it was the "effort or ease with which he passed over
the alternates which formed the pleasure." Another temporal subject
felt the rhythm as the others did, with more emphasis on the
double strings. But the major units seemed the <em>rest-phase</em> in his
rhythm, <em>i. e.</em>, he paused here in observation of the series, although
his attention was most active; <em>vice versa</em>, the minor units required
little attention, but were the active or moving parts of the rhythm.
Since they all considered the strings in the alternate space merely
as steps or lesser beats on the way to the major element which they
sought, and as obstacles rather than otherwise, why did they prefer
the space with two strings rather than one? This suggested that
some factor in the alternate spaces was important other than simply
the amount of resistance to overcome in getting past the two lines.
In answer to this they could only say that the two strings in the
alternate space formed a pleasanter unity by itself, although, as they
went across, they did not think of it in terms of unity.</p>

<p>What, then, is the real rest-phase of the rhythm of alternating
repeated objects?</p>

<p>In the beginning of the discussion, when the analogy between
visual and auditory rhythm was felt so strongly in a certain type
of subject, they had expressed themselves as if the object which
they called the unit of the repeated series were the active stimulated
part of the experience, while the alternate space was the rest-phase,
valuable only as a period of repose or blankness before the
object was again encountered. But in this case, although they felt
they were putting no attention or emphasis on this space, in reality
they were keenly alive to what was hung in it, even preferring more
"hindrance" in the way of strings than less, which suggested that
the alternate space was of more value than they were conscious of.
(Some of this increase in pleasure was of course due to the increased
actual distance between the double strings, but some also to the
extra string.) The introspection on this question as to which part
of the rhythm was actually the rest-phase (if there were any such)
was difficult for them all. They felt they spent more <em>time</em> on the
major element; that was what they looked for and found pleasure
in meeting again.</p>

<p>One said, "The unit is what I look for; as soon as I have it the
pleasure ends and I want to move on again. The pleasure does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
consist in resting on it after it is found, but in knowing I am going
to meet it again, and in doing so." As to the alternate spaces, he
could only say he was not consciously interested in them, he took
them for granted, but knew he should feel it, if they were changed.
His feeling for them was wholly negative. The other temporal subjects
agreed essentially with this. The alternate figures had to be
passed, but passing them was only of importance as it helped or
hindered the perceiving of the major elements. All agreed that
any change was noticed and felt irritating at once, although they
could not understand how it should, since so little attention was
paid them normally. One subject felt the alternating strings only
as obstacles between the doubles, and demanded an actual, empty
rest-period between any repeated units. When asked if it were really
the rest-period <em>between</em> elements or <em>on</em> them, he said he felt there
was a complete discharge of attention on the major units, and an
attempted one on the minor or alternate units, and the attempted
ones became confused.</p>

<p>These introspections would point to the fact that alternate minor
spaces while affording rest for the attention were periods of activity
of some other kind. The fact that no one could say <em>what</em> kind, and
yet insisted on the feeling of its being important and distinctive,
and moreover repudiated the idea of change in a minor space even
more than in a major&mdash;this seemed to show that there was a value
in the alternate spaces quite aside from attention, but fully as distinct
in its own way.</p>

<p>As might be expected, those of my subjects to whom rhythm was
not a conscious factor of the experience of repetition could not understand
exactly what was meant by the distinction between <em>rest-phase</em>
and <em>emphasis</em> of rhythm. In all the preceding cases where
the temporal type gave the introspection I have described, the spatial
subjects grouped the single lines, in Fig. 2, about the heavier
pair as centre, and moved from the centre of one such group to
the next. The experience then consisted of a succession of adjacent
symmetrical groups, connected by movement from centre to centre.
When asked if there was no pleasure in finding equal distances
between their centres, <em>i. e.</em>, any temporal element whatever, they
all denied feeling any. They could not detect that they <em>felt</em> the distances
between their centres as equal, although they <em>knew</em> them to
be. They spent so much attention on the group that all feeling of
the distance between its centre and the last was lost before going
on to the next.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>These two marked types of apperception of an alternating series
seem varieties of <em>emphasis</em>, rather than of actual experience. It was
evident that those in the spatial type must have some recollection
of the amount of distance passed over between the various groups
to feel the whole series as connected in any way; while those of the
temporal type could not be wholly absorbed with the separate lines
of the series as they traversed it, but were distinctly conscious of
the space relations of those in the side of the field that they had
just passed or were coming to.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img  src="images/i_204.jpg" alt="Fig 3" />
</div>

<p>Next, I tried to see what were the different factors which made
up the value of the minor spaces. By varying both their size and
filling, and doing the same to the major element, I could judge the
relative value of these changes on the two, and their effect on the
whole series.</p>

<p>The test was made in the following manner. The series as it
stood consisted of a double line alternating with a single one.</p>

<p>With every temporal subject the double line was conceived to
be the repeated thing, and the space between considered as an alternate,
with a repeated line of its own, to be sure, but not felt in the
same way as the other. With the spatial type, the single line was
merely the limiting edge of the symmetrical figure, with a double
line in the centre. One subject varied back and forth in his method
of apperception, and considered the richness and variety of these
different apperceptions as one of the chief sources of the pleasure
therein.</p>

<p><em>Variation of alternating spaces:</em> The minor spaces were varied
by hanging two strings in one, and one in the other, and subject
asked how such a change affected his feeling for them. The change
was marked.</p>

<p>The spaces which had before been minor were so no longer. The
alternate space in which two strings were hung with the boundary-line
of the two double strings became the new element, and the
alternate in which only <em>one</em> string was hung continued to be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
alternate in the new series. The whole series shifted itself, and
settled into a new equilibrium. Some of the subjects were able to
feel all the former minor spaces still as such, but only by a definite
effort, and not while taking any pleasure in it. The change in the
alternates spoilt the whole scheme of the repetition as it already
stood, and made a regrouping necessary. I next tried varying
alternates by removing a string at intervals.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img  src="images/i_205a.jpg" alt="Fig 4" />
</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="figcenter">
<img  src="images/i_205b.jpg" alt="Fig 5" />
</div>

<p>Since the strings were not removed in any regular fashion, and
because the subject could not find any possible consecutive way
to group them with the double strings, this variation was partially
overlooked, and although confusing the series somewhat, repetition
of the double strings could still be felt. Thus a mere <em>gap</em> where
the scheme remained the same was not so disturbing as an extra
feature inserted, or one noticeably changed. Something could be
supplied by the subject, but not altered so easily. In these cases,
however, the change was only tolerated because it was ignored.
They felt it as a mistake and so overlooked it, but, accepted as a
component part of the series, it was impossible to feel it as a repetition
or get pleasure from it.</p>

<p>The next variation was in the position of alternate figures. With
a three-group as the major element of the repetition and a pair of
strings in the alternate space, the size of the two minor spaces was
altered, thus making the distance between the three-group and adjacent
pair shorter than between that and the next three-group. This
immediately threw out the feeling for the old series and made a
new one. The new series thus formed varied with the different
subjects, although no particular difference was noticed between
spatial and temporal types. They all disliked the new arrangement,
in whichever of a variety of ways it was apperceived. (It will be
noted the actual distance between the three-groups was not varied,
but the size of the spaces each side of the minor figure, <em>i. e.</em>, the
minor figure was shifted from its central position.) One typical
spatial subject took it in either of three ways: (1) He grouped the
three-group and pair nearest together, into the repeated element of
the new series; (2) he ignored the pair and regarded it as a repetition
of three-groups; or (3) ignored the difference in the division of
the alternates, and regarded them as alike. The artificiality of the
latter methods of taking the series is evident. What pleasure survived
after such a strain was very slight, and was moreover not of
the series as given, but as imagined differently, which was not a
valid judgment. Most of the subjects grouped both figures into one,
and, finding the unity thus made ugly and unsymmetrical, derived
no pleasure from it. One tried to keep both elements in separate
series and have them go along together, equally distant from those
of their own kind, although not from each other. This was, however,
very fatiguing and unsatisfactory. Those who grouped the
different figures said they did so because they could not help it, not
because they liked it, and said it was impossible to regard the alternate
figure as such, if varied from its central position. If they were
all varied together, they were grouped, with the major unit, into a
new one. If varied irregularly the series was spoiled&mdash;no rhythm
whatever remained. It became a heap.</p>

<p>Next, I tried varying the size of the alternate spaces, keeping the
filling in its central position.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img  src="images/i_206.jpg" alt="Fig 7" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>Here also it was universally regrouped. They found it more
difficult to feel the rhythm of the three-groups as separate elements
than when the minor spaces had remained uniform in size, but
different in the position of the filling. The alternate space, then,
which had at first seemed the unimportant part of the rhythm and
for which no subject could assign any conscious value whatever,
was evidently a potent factor of the experience, and when varied
either in size or filling (especially the former) it not only changed
the feeling-tone, but shifted the entire scheme of the rhythm, or broke
it up altogether.</p>

<p><em>Variation of major units:</em> Was variation more allowable in the
major than in the minor unit of a series? This was tested first in
the same manner as for accents. In a series of which a double string
was the major element, a third string was hung with every such
double, thus changing the unit in both size and content.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img  src="images/i_207a.jpg" alt="Fig 8" />
</div>

<p>The series immediately readjusted itself with the three-group
as element for most of the subjects, although one was still able to
feel them all as one unit, varied by the added string. Varying only
the <em>size</em> of the major unit gave the same result.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img  src="images/i_207b.jpg" alt="Fig 9" />
</div>

<p>The pairs, instead of remaining the same size, were made alternately
larger and smaller, and a new repetition was made, <em>i. e.</em>, with
the larger pair as major element and the smaller one as minor.
They all agreed, however, that less change was made in these cases
than when the <em>minor</em> spaces had been changed in size. In the latter
case either a regrouping was made, changing the whole character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
of the series, or it was spoiled altogether. With change of <em>major</em>
units alone, however, although a new element was made, it was
still possible to take it in the old way without much difficulty or
change in feeling-tone.</p>

<p>It was then necessary to see how change of content would affect
the major unit, the size remaining constant. A group of two sets
of double strings 10 ccm. apart was taken as the repeated element,
and these groups placed at 10 ccm. from each other.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img  src="images/i_208.jpg" alt="Fig 10" />
</div>

<p>Within one element was hung one string, and within the next
two, thus varying the content while the size remained constant.
In every case the answer was the same. It was not so pleasant as
when the filling was the same, but the group still remained the unit
of the repetition, and the series essentially the same.</p>

<p>Several variations were made in this element. Instead of hanging
strings regularly (1 in one, and 2 in the next) they were hung
irregularly, <em>i. e.</em>, an extra one here and there at intervals in no special
order. As long as the boundary-lines of each group remained at the
same distance from each other, and from the next group, thus keeping
the unit at uniform size, although the pleasure-tone varied, the
balance of the series was not changed. No regrouping or shifting
of the equilibrium resulted.</p>

<p>It would seem from the preceding experiments that in any series
variation of the <em>major unit</em> was tolerated more than of the <em>alternate</em>;
while in <em>either case</em> variation in <em>content</em> had less influence than
variation in <em>size</em>.</p>

<p><em>Symmetry:</em> In the previous experiment, three subjects had insisted
on symmetry as a necessary attribute both of the unit and
its alternate. U. (spatial type) described his experience as "a succession
of symmetrical experiences or states of equilibrium; when
they are not so, they must be regrouped, or pleasure is impossible."
R. (temporal type) insisted especially on the necessity of the alternate
figure being symmetrical as regards the major units, <em>i. e.</em>, halfway
between them; and also on symmetry as regards itself. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
temporal subject said there was some pleasure in merely going
from one unit to the next, even though no repose was possible on
each because of its asymmetry. This suggested experiments on the
importance of symmetry in repeated series. Is it necessary that the
separate elements of a series be symmetrical? Must both major
and minor element be symmetrical? Does this necessity vary according
to the temporal or spatial type of the subject, <em>i. e.</em>, is it more
necessary to the spatial type, whose pleasure depends more on repose
in the unit, than to the temporal type, whose enjoyment rests
mainly in the rhythm of movement from one unit to the next? Or
is it a common demand? This experiment was begun in the following
simple way. The strings were hung in two group-forms;
one with three and the other with four.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img  src="images/i_209a.jpg" alt="Fig 11" />
</div>

<p>This was a symmetrical grouping and uniformly pleasant. The
series was then changed by removing the second string in the four-group,
thereby making it unsymmetrical.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img  src="images/i_209b.jpg" alt="Fig 12" />
</div>

<p>This change made the repetition less pleasant in every case, but
did not spoil it. Instead of the four-groups becoming more prominent
they seemed less so, and the three-group on account of its "compactness"
became in most cases the major element, thereby shifting
the balance of the repetition, but not detracting very much from
the pleasure. Next the three-group was changed by moving the
middle string to the left. By this means the group which had been
minor in Fig. 11, became unsymmetrical, while the four-group was
regular.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img  src="images/i_210a.jpg" alt="Fig 13" />
</div>

<p>This change was preferred to that in Fig. 12, although different
reasons were given. One said it was because this change in arrangement
made the elements more distinct, hence easier to keep apart,
while in Fig. 12 they were made more alike. Moreover, one element
seemed as important as the other. He did not class them as major
or minor, so he could not compare the relative values of symmetry
in principal and alternate units, for in this series he did not feel
the distinction. The other answers to this question were rather incoherent,
but the series did not seem to suffer much change, either
pleasantly or otherwise. Since lack of symmetry in <em>the element</em> was
at least tolerated in the examples already given, would it be allowable
so to place the units that the two adjacent to any one unit should
lie unsymmetrically on either side, that is, may the elements lie
unsymmetrically with regard to one another? Suppose a four-group
to be repeated at regular intervals, and a three-group likewise;
if the two series were combined, must they occur halfway
between each other? That is, must they be symmetrically placed
as regards the intervening space, or could they be put to one side?</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img  src="images/i_210b.jpg" alt="Fig 14" />
</div>

<p>The subject was asked not to group them (as in previous similar
arrangements), but to keep them as separate repetitions if possible,
and to see if this equal distance was necessary to keep them apart.
The result was the same in all cases. The subjects could not help
grouping them, and found it impossible to keep them distinct unless
so much effort was put into it that no pleasure was left. They
said they "<em>knew</em> each unit was as equally distant from the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
unit in its <em>own</em> series, as if it did not come at unequal distances
from the units in the other, but they could not feel it so, and were
obliged to group the two together." For this reason the experiments
did not satisfactorily illustrate the point in question. It was necessary
to have a series of elements whose unity was more strongly
marked, and whose different parts would still remain one <em>whole</em>
even after variations, instead of shifting into each other. It was
suggested by these imperfect experiments that symmetry was <em>not</em>
so important a factor in the different units of a series as the subjects
had previously supposed; but that, on the other hand, the
different units must be placed at equal distances from each other,
if they are to be kept distinct either as two series or as one. Moreover,
that <em>two</em> series could not be kept distinctly in mind as separate,
<em>anyway</em>, without fatigue, the tendency being always to group
them into one series with a new repeated element, composed of a
combination of the other two. It was necessary, however, to test
this more completely. By a simple device the former series was
changed radically, so that the difficulties mentioned were overcome.
The strings of both the three and four groups were twisted
together at the bottom, thus binding them closely into separate
unities. By remaining attached at the bottom, whatever variations
might occur elsewhere in the figures, they could not lose their individuality
and become merged in each other as before. They remained
distinct groups without effort on the part of the subject.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img  src="images/i_211.jpg" alt="Fig 15" />
</div>

<p>With this I began as in the previous experiment. The subject
was asked to look at the series of repetitions, enjoy them as much
as possible, telling what was the pleasant factor in the experience,
and how he apperceived the series. The subjects separated into
types as before; the spatial type immediately grouping the elements
into a larger unity and enjoying the groups more for their
own sake than for their repetition, while the temporal type went
from one to the next in the series, enjoying the <em>rhythm</em> more than
the elements as such. (It may be remarked here that the subjects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
were perfectly naÃ¯ve as to their apperception. They did not know
they were separated into types, nor were they urged to be consistent.
Even the experimenter did not know of the distinctness with which
these types separated themselves, and consistently held to their
own method of apperception, until looking over the records afterwards.)</p>

<p>With the temporal type the four-group was the major group.
Some expressed its prominence in terms of <em>time</em>, <em>i. e.</em>, they spent
more time on it, and less on the three-group. One felt it as emphasized,
because he moved from one four-group to the next like
it, and at each step moved back and forth from left to right, to see
the alternate three-groups on each side, always <em>resting</em> on the four-groups.</p>

<p>It is noticeable with these subjects, in whom the rhythmic element
was more strongly developed, that although they admitted
that the language of "temporal rhythm" did not adequately cover
their experience (because the element did not disappear after perception
as in auditory rhythm, but remained in the visual field),
still they could not express themselves in other terms. L., the most
extreme of this type, insisted that the experience of repetition would
be exactly as pleasant if he saw the elements pass one by one behind
a moving window, with never more than one in the field at once.
In other words, their temporal relations were all he felt.</p>

<p>The others did not go so far as this, and agreed to the significance
of the whole field, even while especially interested in passing
from one to the next. B. partook of the characteristics of both
types, and by combining the apperceptions of both bridged the
chasm between them.</p>

<p>With the four spatial subjects, the apperception showed its usual
divergence. Three grouped the elements, either with the three-group
in the centre on account of its being more compact and graceful,
or the four-group because it was heavier. One of them could
group it either way, distinguishing between the prominence in an
element due to <em>interest</em> and due to <em>beauty</em>, <em>i. e.</em>, he found the four-group
more noticeable and interesting on account of its size, while
the three-group was more beautiful as a unity, on account of its
proportion and grace. Therefore according as one factor or the
other predominated, one or the other figure was taken as the more
prominent element, and placed in the centre of the group. Sometimes
they separated into two series running along together, but
this was not usual.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p>Having got these varied introspections, with yet a certain likeness
running through them, the balance of the four-group and
of the three-group were varied in turns, to see how the change in
symmetry of elements would affect the series; and the relative value
of symmetry for the major and minor units of a series.</p>

<p>First, the four-group was altered, by moving the second string
further to the left, while the three-group remained symmetrical.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img  src="images/i_213.jpg" alt="Fig. 16" />
</div>

<p>In three cases this arrangement was preferred to the regular one
previous, and each time for the same reason. The four-group was
made more noticeable by being unsymmetrical, and hence more
easily distinguished from the other. The two were easier kept apart,
and the alternation between the two was made more clear-cut and
obvious. With others the change was unpleasant for the reason
that it affected them in an exactly opposite manner. The four-group
<em>lost</em> its individuality, and, by separation into two unsymmetrical
parts, could not be distinguished so well from the three-groups
as formerly, hence the effect was spoiled.</p>

<p>A distinction was made between the relative <em>importance</em> and <em>interest</em>
attached to the units, when symmetrical and when unsymmetrical.
Every one agreed that making the four-group unsymmetrical
gave it more prominence of a certain kind. With the first
three subjects mentioned, this prominence was enough to accent
the rhythm still more than before, and differentiate the two units
more strongly. But with the other there was a feeling that while it
gained prominence and was more <em>noticeable</em>, it lost coherence and
interest, thence it could not be kept as the principal unit, but the
attention passed over to the three-group which maintained its unity.</p>

<p>It would seem, then, that the mere fact of one unit in a series
alternating with another, and being more noticeable, taking up
a larger space, being more complicated, etc., did not insure its being
the chief unit in the series. One subject voiced essentially the
feeling of all, in his comment on the series: "There is a constant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
struggle between the prominence which the four-group gains from
size and eccentricity, and the insignificance which it deserves on
account of its looseness and lack of unity; it cannot hold its own
as one individual thing, and because the three-group still does, it
becomes in one way more prominent, while the four-group remains
so in another." Another subject felt he gave more <em>time</em> to the four-group
than before, because being separated it would not bind together
again without effort. At the same time the three-group gained
in interest because it was easy to find and did not vary. Another
subject felt that the <em>time</em> spent on a unit had nothing to do with
its rhythm; it was all a matter of interest and attention. Often he
looked a longer time at one unit, choosing another for the chief
element in his series, because it interested him more.</p>

<p>All this introspection brought out two things clearly:</p>

<p>(1) The apperception of a series of alternating units, whether
of the spatial or temporal type, is not fixed, but any variation of its
unit is liable to shift the emphasis. Thus, as in the present case,
when a symmetrical major unit is made unsymmetrical, it may not
remain the principal unit, but becomes the minor one, because the
attention shifts to the other which was before relatively unimportant.</p>

<p>(2) Whether either element shall be the principal one or not,
does not depend wholly on its objective prominence, but on the
amount of beauty or interest which it holds for the observer. Neither
size, complexity, nor eccentricity can force a certain unit to be taken
as the major in a series, unless it thereby presents an interest which
makes the observer choose it.</p>

<p>The next change was to vary the three-group in a similar way,
by pushing the middle string to the left, thereby making it unsymmetrical.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img  src="images/i_214.jpg" alt="Fig 17" />
</div>

<p>The responses were as follows: Five said it did more violence
to the series to have the alternate varied than the major unit; it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
was more confusing. Three preferred it, giving as their reason that
it made the elements more different from each other than before,
hence more easily distinguished. The preponderance of evidence
was, therefore, that, although any variation from symmetry in a
unit was likely to be detrimental to the repetition, it was more
likely to be tolerable in the major unit than in the alternate space.
In either case it was demanded that the two units be distinctly different,
and it depended on the individual subject, whether in this
experiment the variation of one unit or the other brought out this
distinction more obviously. Aside from this consideration, however,
it appeared that the alternate spaces as such required equilibrium
more than the principal unit. Also, variation of symmetry in
the major unit, while it made it more prominent in the way of <em>eccentricity</em>,
also made the symmetrical minor unit more prominent in the
way of <em>interest</em>. As one subject expressed it, "Since the others vary,
the attention requires something which does <em>not</em> vary, and forces
prominence on the minor unit, because it remains symmetrical";
and "The minor unit is too small to merit such prominence as it
gets by lack of symmetry. It is distorted, and has not enough content
to bear it."</p>

<p>These introspections from temporal and spatial subject alike,
all point to the fact of a certain <em>value</em> attached to the alternating
units in a series. (1) The units must not be too much alike in <em>interest</em>,
or they rival each other. (2) They must not have more prominence
given them as regards the whole than they have interest to
sustain. (3) There must be a congruity between the two elements
so that one shall not be noticeable in one way, and one in another,
thus carrying the attention in two different directions.</p>

<p>One more thing was suggested by this experiment: (4) The subjects
who had invariably <em>grouped</em> their different elements in other
series found it very difficult to do so in this, or wholly impossible.
None of them did so when taking the series naturally, but moved
on from one to the next just as the rhythmic type did. They felt
"forced to move on," "no place to rest," while one in whom the
rhythmic feeling was weakest was much fatigued by this movement,
and insisted on having something stable to rest upon if he
was to gain any pleasure at all.</p>

<p>Next the series was varied by making both units unsymmetrical;
first with the balance tipping the same, and second in opposite
ways.</p>

<p>Those who preferred this gave essentially the same reason. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
agreed that the unity of both elements was broken up by this change,
and they did not stand out distinctly from each other; but all felt
a certain <em>congruity</em> in having both major and minor units follow
the same scheme in composition. They were not distinctly an
alternating series, but harmonized better as lines. The two spatial
subjects, who disliked this arrangement more than the other, gave
the same reason: the unity of the elements was spoiled, they did
not "hang together." Their dislike was similar in kind to that of
the others, only the congruity which made up for it with the former
failed to satisfy these. With the symmetry broken and the balance
tipping in different ways, the feeling was not strong in either direction.
They still criticised it in the same terms of congruity and distinctness,
with no especial change on account of this modification.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 560px;">
<img  src="images/i_216.jpg" alt="Fig 18 A Fig 18 B" />
</div>

<p>These experiments all pointed to the fact that (1) a certain amount
of congruity and equality was necessary between elements of a
series (although it did not establish what were the essential features
of such a harmony). (2) It is more pleasant, as a rule, to have
the elements symmetrical, although symmetry was not a necessity
for an agreeable series. (3) Provided the change in the symmetry of
the units was not enough to shift the whole order of the series, changing
the major to minor units (and <em>vice versa</em>), any varying of the
symmetry of a minor unit was more disturbing to the repetition
than of the major, while varying their symmetrical position, as
regards the unit on either side, was absolutely destructive to the
order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>The next experiment dealt with a different side of the question.
Since the unit of a repeated series may be a group with repetitions
inside itself, does the repetition of lines or figures <em>inside</em> the group
differ from the repetition of the groups as a whole? If so, how?
That is, in the enjoyment of a series of groups with repeated lines
in the group, in what respect does our apperception of the repetition
differ in the two cases? Or does it in reality differ at all?</p>

<p>To test this, the strings were arranged in the following way. 10
groups of five strings were hung 100 mm. wide and 100 mm. apart.
Each unit had, then, five repetitions within it.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img  src="images/i_217.jpg" alt="Fig 19" />
</div>

<p>The arrangement was pleasant to all the subjects, and they described
the effect of the experience, falling at once into the spatial
and temporal types as before (this was wholly naÃ¯ve, for the same
questions were asked of each, and they had no idea of being grouped
in types). The introspection of both types must be taken in some
detail, to fully analyze the experience.</p>

<p><em>Spatial:</em> J. felt he took in all groups at once. Each unit seemed
like a rich experience in itself, but he could not detect any rhythm
in it, nor in the whole series. The pleasure consisted in getting a
number of similar objects in the field at once, and enjoying the combination
of them all, feeling that they stretched away in each direction.
H. and U. grouped several unit-groups into a larger unity and
enjoyed the cluster as a whole. They did not group them in any
particular system, nor could they detect the slightest pleasure in
moving from one such group to the next. One found his enjoyment
solely in the contrast effects in each, while the other laid it to the
space relations of each independently. The pleasure only came when
each group of groups was spread before him. Those outside the
immediate field meant nothing to him, and the movement between
them had absolutely no conscious interest for him. S. said that
enjoyment stopped altogether during motion of any kind, and
the experience was pleasant only during total repose, on whatever
happened to be in his field at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>With the temporal type came a marked difference in apperception.</p>

<p>B. affirmed the pleasure to <em>consist</em> in going from one cluster to
another, and to <em>begin</em> just at the point where he meets the next
stimulation and feels it is <em>going to be</em> the same as the one previous.
It is the <em>expectation</em>, rather than the <em>verification</em> recurring at intervals,
which makes up the pleasure; not the actual movement, or
subsequent contemplation of a group. The pleasure came in pulses;
in knowing by seeing from the side of the eyes that the experience
<em>is to be</em> repeated, and on reaching the edge of a new group, in the
feeling that the experience is just about to begin.</p>

<p>R. felt that she "wriggled around" in each group of lines, and
that a certain <em>feeling</em> came from "wriggling" among the lines in
a particular fashion.</p>

<p>The pleasure consisted in having this feeling recur at regular
intervals. The repetitions inside the group and of the group as a
whole differed in this respect: For the separate unit-group, it apparently
consisted in repeated short irregular movements, back and
forth, enough to bring about a certain feeling which seemed pleasant
and sufficient unto itself. Repetition of the groups as a whole
meant movement across the field in one direction, for the purpose
of meeting another group, and getting the required feeling from it
again. The pleasure was not in the movement or in any repose
(she could detect no repose at all), but in experiencing the group
again, feeling that it had been so before, and would be again.</p>

<p>L. (the most extreme of the temporal type) agreed with R. that
the lines inside the group were perceived and enjoyed <em>temporally</em>,
as well as the groups as a whole. There was no experiencing the
groups <em>at once</em>. He felt that he moved regularly across the field encountering
five lines, one after the other, then an empty space, then
five lines more. The only meaning which the group as such had
for him was the five accents which came near one another in time.
He could feel no unity whatever apart from this. He was even certain
that his pleasure would be identical if in some mechanical
way the same figure could be pushed forward, so that the same
amount of time and movement would be necessary to reach it that
was required to move from one figure to the next on the field.
The experience was in every way analogous to auditory rhythm
with him, and he was unable to express himself in other than temporal
terms. Immediate perception, repose on the object, or groupings,
had no significance for him.</p>

<p>The other two subjects were links between the extremes already
described. They could feel each group, and sometimes even the
whole series <em>at once</em> apparently, and yet were all the time conscious
of a certain rhythm in going from one to the next. The whole experience
seemed immediate at first, but on reflection a certain alternate
rhythm was felt to be present, which was too rapid to take
any considerable time, but yet had to be included as a factor in
the experience. These introspections I believe to throw light on
the nature of the whole experience of repetition. Since there are
two methods of apperception so extreme, but moreover certain subjects
partake of the characteristics of both, it might seem that both
types represent but <em>one</em> side of the experience. Since both are enjoying
the same objective series, but in their description of their
feeling in face of it emphasize such different sides (leaving at the
same time the other side unaccounted for), and since certain subjects
share the experience of both, it might be that the sum of both
methods of apperception was necessary to the fullest appreciation
of the repetition in question, only in certain subjects one aspect of
it was so much stronger that the other possible factors in the experience
were overlooked.</p>

<p>It would tend to bear out this view, that when it was suggested to
those of the temporal type (always excepting L.) that according
to their description the other groups remaining in the field, after
having performed their part in a temporal series, <em>ought</em> to have no
further influence in the repetition, whereas they did in reality, they
admitted the fact, but could not account for it. Moreover, those
of the spatial type admitted that their enjoyment in having spaces
equal, and in having repeated objects exactly like one another, had
a certain character which no other experience possessed. This did
not seem accounted for by any description they could give of its
effect on them, although they could not detect what this other
elusive factor might be.</p>

<p>These introspections, therefore, and the confessions on the part
of both that there was a feeling of something <em>more</em> which they could
not hold long enough to describe, suggested that both types were
but opposite ends of a series of possible apperceptive types, and
that in both cases certain essential features were emphasized at the
expense of the others.</p>

<p>After these experiments, the next step was to find how a series
of groups was apperceived when the lines in each group were arranged
symmetrically about a centre, as distinguished from their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
arrangement at invariable distances apart. The same number and
size of groups were taken, but the arrangement of lines in each
varied as stated above.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img  src="images/i_220.jpg" alt="Fig 20" />
</div>

<p><em>Spatial subjects:</em> J. felt a different kind of pleasure from that
felt with Fig. 19. Here the enjoyment was in each unit for itself,
a certain repose in its symmetry. Although he fixated on the centre
of the groups, and in going across the field moved from centre to
centre, there was no feeling of rhythm whatever, merely enjoyment
of the unit itself. Moreover, although he had <em>detected</em> no rhythm
in the previous experience, this one seemed distinctly different in
having lost a feature that the other had. He felt by comparison
that the other had had a temporal character, some movement in
the groups, which was wholly lacking in this. This was more beautiful
and restful, the other more exciting and rich.</p>

<p>H. and S. both enjoyed this series better on account of possibility
of greater repose in the unit-groups. The pleasure was solely
in each unit for itself, not in their repetition, so the group which
offered most balance and equilibrium in itself was pleasantest. S.
also found enjoyment in slight variations in the groups (trifling
difference in distance, different light effect, etc.). It is noticeable
that when repetition alone was the main feature of the series, any
variation was either ignored or found unpleasant. But when the
unit for itself is the object of enjoyment, variation if slight is another
element of pleasure.</p>

<p>There is also pleasure in the mere <em>repeating</em> of symmetrical groups,
although, when the attention is turned to this feature, the feeling
of <em>symmetry</em> is less felt. Even when attending chiefly to the repetition
of the groups, the symmetry of each is felt somewhat, which
makes the whole experience better than Fig. 19, but the two attitudes
seem to hinder, rather than help each other.</p>

<p>This introspection was suggestive, giving rise to two more questions:
(1) When is variation allowable, and when not? Is it adapted
only to objects when taken, as ends-in-themselves, and not when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
considered as means to something else, <em>i. e.</em>, as means to make a
series or border, or anything which takes attention from themselves
as unities with individual meaning? (2) Is a distinctly symmetrical
group as adapted to repetition, as such, as one with merely equal
divisions? Does it not tend more to repose in itself, instead of to
the motion necessary for the apperception of a repeated series?
These questions will be considered later.</p>

<p><em>Temporal type:</em> R. felt a difference in the movement across, in
that in Fig. 20 it was from the centre of one unit to the next, while
in Fig. 19 there was no regularity in the movement.</p>

<p>L. felt the difference between the two apperceptions very strongly.
In Fig. 20 the movements seemed organized. He felt as if his attention
(if not his eyes) went back and forth from edge to edge of the
unit, finally settling in the centre; while in Fig. 19 the very essence
of the apperception was that every line was compared with every
other, meaning a great number of movements in both directions,
<em>not</em> stopping in the centre. If he did rest finally in the centre,
in the unit of Fig. 19, instead of seeming evenly repeated, it too became
symmetrically perceived, but the usual way to get from one
such unit to the next was to move <em>from</em> and <em>to</em> any point in the next
adjacent, other than the central one. In either case the pleasure
came in identification of the second figure with the first, and the
feeling, "I have seen it before." The pleasure lay in the process
of recurrence of sameness.</p>

<p>V. also, who had not felt much motion in Fig. 19 at first, felt it
strongly now in comparison with Fig. 20. He said in the former,
although he did not make actual movements across (in fact his
eyes were plainly at rest), he was sure he felt "dispositions to do
so" which were lacking in Fig. 20. The pleasure came in the first
moment of repose after finding the new unit was the same as the
old.</p>

<p>After we had investigated the different methods of apperceiving
groups of repeated lines, and compared the effects of different groupings,
and studied the feeling of one unit alternating with another,
another question arose.</p>

<p>These questions had all referred to the alternation of <em>two</em> units;
either a unit with an empty space, or with a space of different filling.
How did the apperception differ when <em>three</em> repeated units
alternated with each other? To test this, three spaces were taken
equally wide (110 mm.) and equally distant from each other (150
mm.), but with three different designs within them. These designs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
were of the same general character and importance although different,
and repeated themselves regularly.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img  src="images/i_222.jpg" alt="Fig 21" />
</div>

<p>The subjects were asked as before to describe their reaction on
the series. Not one of all the number was able to <em>feel</em> the repetition
of the three units; what pleasure they got from the series (if
indeed they got any) was from other sources. The general type of
answer was formulated more fully by L. He saw 1, then looked
for 2 and found it different, but could have included it in the series
if it were not for 3. That being still different sent 1 and 2 out of
mind, so that he could not <em>feel</em> any repetition of 1 when he met it
again. He felt a certain sense of repetition in that the spacing and
general motifs were the same, but there was no pleasure in that.
What pleasure he got was wholly intellectual, not immediate, except
for a slight pleasure in their uniformity of position. In him
the rhythmic feeling had always been of the strongest, but he found
in this experience none whatever. It was simply impossible to keep
the three units going at once. Another temporal subject tried to
group 2 and 3 as one element, with one as an alternate, thus reducing
it to a rhythm of twos. This process was labored, but otherwise
no enjoyment was possible. The spatial subjects derived what
pleasure they could, either from the units separately, with no regard
to their repetition, or from some method of grouping, by which
their difference could be overlooked. One expressed his pleasure
solely in terms of contrast of the white strings against a black ground.
Any immediate feeling for the repetition was impossible for either
type. It will be noticed that the <em>feeling</em> of the repetition is quite
different from the <em>knowing</em> it is there. They were all perfectly conscious
that 1 was repeated again after 3, but could not <em>feel</em> it, while
repeated simply after 2, they <em>could</em> feel it.</p>

<p>Next, the series was varied again. The size of the blocks, instead
of being alike, was varied three ways, while the designs remained
similar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img  src="images/i_223.jpg" alt="Fig 22" />
</div>

<p>The interspaces were 150 mm. in every case, but 1 was 150 mm.
wide; 2 = 110 mm.; 3 = 70 mm. All the spatial subjects found
Fig. 22 worse than Fig. 21. The irregularity and general disorder
was more pronounced. Although the rhythm had never consciously
given them pleasure, and, when not violated, was never noticed,
still the threefold difference in size violates some feeling which
they can only express in rhythmic terms. Some tried to group the
three units into a larger group, but this being unsymmetrical displeased
them. Others picked out the most satisfactorily proportioned
unit and ignored the others, but any possible apperception
was irritating. The temporal subjects found it equally poor. They
felt the continual dissatisfaction of having their expectation, that
the adjacent unit should be the same, disappointed. They all said
that they could carry the feeling of repetition over <em>one</em> dissimilar
unit (<em>i. e.</em>, in an alternating series of two different units), but that
the third difference completely upset the scheme. When only the
filling varied as in Fig. 21, it could be partially ignored, but difference
in size could not be ignored, and only the equal distances apart
kept them from being a heap. They could not <em>feel</em> the evenness of
the empty interspaces, however. They were not consciously present
in the experience at all, they merely <em>knew</em> they must be even. There
was no feeling-tone whatever to the empty alternates.</p>

<p>Only one subject preferred Fig. 22 to Fig. 21, and the reason
was obvious. 1, 2, and 3 appeared as the same unit where variation
in size was apperceived as due to perspective. Thus, instead
of appearing as three units repeated, they were one set which progressed
by means of "pulsations" or regular intervals of perspective.
This gave an added richness to the rhythm, and was very
pleasant. As three separate units of different size, there was no
meaning in the series whatever.</p>

<p>It is evident from these introspections that, although the likes
and dislikes may vary, the principles on which they are based have
much in common.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>The points on which they agreed unanimously were the following:</p>

<p>(1) There is no feeling of repetition for three separate units.
The series may be enjoyed by means of subjective grouping of one
kind or another, but as separate elements, the feeling of repetition
is broken by adding the third.</p>

<p>(2) There is a distinction between perceiving or <em>knowing</em> a repetition,
and <em>feeling</em> it. Even though a subject is equally conscious
that elements are repeated according to some scheme in two different
cases, he may feel it in one case and not in the other.</p>

<p>(3) The empty spaces between the elements have no conscious
part to play in the experience. Even when there is a figure in the
alternate space, it comes very little into consciousness as part of
the repetition, yet it is alterations in these alternates which make
or mar the feeling of repetition. A series may not be beautiful
in itself, but if the alternates are regular, it <em>feels</em> repeated. <em>Vice
versa</em>, the units may be enjoyable in themselves, but they do not
feel repeated unless the alternates are regular and conform to certain
requirements. In the units lies the <em>meaning</em> of the repetition,
in the regular alternates the possibility of its expression.</p>

<p>(4) The rhythmic character of repetition is not felt by a certain
type of subject, when it goes smoothly. When a variation is made
which would destroy any possible rhythm, its lack is felt, and its
violation finds expression only in rhythmic terms.</p>

<p>(5) More violation is done to a series to have the <em>size</em> of units
varied than the filling. (This corroborates previous experiments.)</p>

<p>(6) A certain amount of ignoring and regrouping can be done
by the subject. The series is not taken exactly as given, but with
selective attention.</p>

<p>(7) In a series of different elements alternating, the most prominent
one is chosen for the major unit, and the others for alternates.
This prominence is more influenced by <em>size</em> than any other factor,
but may be due to intrinsic interest of any kind.</p>

<p>(8) The major and minor elements must have a certain difference
from each other, both in <em>appearance</em> and <em>interest</em>, and they
must be different enough for the difference to be easily perceived,
but not enough to be incongruous. They must differ in interest
enough, so that one is easily more prominent than the other, or
may be made subservient to the other, in the apperception.</p>

<p>(9) Variations are pleasant in the principal unit repeated, but
not in the alternating figure unless very slight indeed, or affecting
only secondary parts of the figure, not the main lines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p>(10) Not the time actually spent on a unit makes it more or less
prominent, but the feeling of more or less "energy" expended on it.</p>

<p><em>Ends:</em> In an alternating repetition, must the series end on a light
or heavy beat? That is, must the major or minor unit be on the
end?</p>

<p>To test this a series of strings was hung in which a group of three
alternated with a single string.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img  src="images/i_225.jpg" alt="Fig 23" />
</div>

<p>The subjects were asked to look at it with the three-groups on the
end, and with the single string. In every case the three-group ending
was emphatically declared the best. What reasons were given
were much the same, although most of them could give no explanation
at all. S. said the minor space on the end left him "hanging
in mid-air, it needs the heavy beat to land me again." Others said
it was "ragged" unless the three-group ended the series. R. said
anything <em>interesting</em> would do on the end, as well as the larger-sized
unit, it simply needed something of sufficient interest to stop the
rhythmic process and keep one from going on.</p>

<p>It was impossible to describe the experience except in rhythmic
terms, and those in whom this sense was not strong could give no
account whatever for the difference in their feeling for <em>end</em>.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that some experiments were previously
described relating to the difference in apperception of a group of
lines equally distant from one another, and a group averaged at
equal distances each side of a middle point, but unequally from each,
to emphasize the bilateral symmetry. Two such series were now
taken to find if there were any difference necessary in appropriate
endings. Since the two types of groups differed so much in apperception,
did that difference so extend to the whole series that a different
space was needed at the end to finish them off?</p>

<p>The method of experiment was the following: Two series of
repeated groups were hung (100 mm. wide and 100 mm. between)
with the design of the groups varied as described. At the end of each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
a strip of cardboard was hung, which the subject was asked to move
so that it bounded the amount of space at the end, necessary to
finish the series adequately.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img  src="images/i_226.jpg" alt="Fig 24 I Fig 24 II" />
</div>

<p>Thus <em>b</em> is the cardboard strip, and <em>a</em> the space which was to be
varied according to his taste. The same experiment was tried with
each series, with the following results:</p>

<p>In the case of every one but J. the subjects preferred a longer end
space with I than with II. J. was, however, of the extreme spatial
type who gave as his explanation that with II, when the central line
was prominent, the end (<em>a</em>) must equal just the distance to another
middle line, while with I it must harmonize with the shorter distances
in the group, but not exactly equal them, for that would make
it too narrow.</p>

<p>It would mean, then, that the apperception of the repeated group
in I (if it accords with the subject's own introspection) consists in
repeated fluctuations of attention over the five strings, with no repose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
on any one more than another. The movement is back and forth from
edge to edge, and hence needs more of an end to finish it than in
a series of symmetrical units where the movement is not back and
forth, but balanced and resting on the central point. In other
words, in Group I there is a rhythm of movement within the group
itself, as well as of the whole, while in II it is balanced and coÃ¶rdinated
from the centre of each group, out and back, so that a longer,
or at least more important end of some description is necessary to
break the rhythm, and stop the series in I than in II.</p>

<p>It is noticeable also that H. and S. thought in both cases they
were making the end spaces equal to the interspaces; but after
Series I, <em>a</em> was made 102 and 109; and after Series II 95 and 104
respectively. This naturally raised another question: Does a series
of groups, with repetitions within each, tend to make one overestimate
distances between or at the end, or at least does one overestimate
these distances in comparison with a series of symmetrical units?</p>

<p>The subjects were so unanimous in preferring a larger "embankment"
after Series I than II, that it was useless to test them further
on that point, and the experiment was changed to the other question
according to the suggestion above.</p>

<p>A series of eight cards was prepared (125 mm. wide) on four of
which five heavy black strips were drawn equally distant from each
other, and on the others a much wider strip in the centre with another
on each side near the edges. Of the two series just made, one
was composed of what we have called "rhythmic units" and the
other of "symmetrical units."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img  src="images/i_227.jpg" alt="Fig 25" />
</div>

<p>The subjects were asked to arrange the two separate series so that
the interspaces should be exactly equal to the units. It will be observed
that the rhythmic unit had a black strip on each edge, thereby
apparently decreasing its size, while the edge of the symmetrical
unit was white. In this respect the comparison was hardly fair, but
the result was the following. The figures represent an average of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
two trials, and stand for the size estimate of the interspaces for each
subjects respectively, in the two series.</p>

<p>Average difference of estimate of both series = 2.64. Mean variation = 1.37.</p>

<p>It might be contended, however, that Series I is an example of
optical illusion, that the card was overestimated for that reason,
and the interspaces necessarily made wider. To avoid this difficulty
another series was made. Two sets of cards (125 mm. wide) were
prepared; one with five black strips at equal distances apart as before
(excepting that the strips were made heavier), the other with six
strips. The card with an odd number of strips had thereby a strip in
the middle upon which the attention could centre,&mdash;possessed a kind
of balance. The card with an even number of strips had, moreover,
no such central line but only a space, thus preventing repose of
attention, and making the unit more pronouncedly rhythmic. (It will
be noticed in the foregoing table that one subject, V, made narrower
interspaces in I than in II. He said he felt the units as centring
around the group of three lines in the centre, not as proceeding equally
to the edge. The unit became thus for him symmetrical instead
of rhythmic, which could easily account for the difference in estimation.)</p>

<p>The results in the present case are an average of three trials:</p>

<p>Average difference in estimate of both series = 6.1. Mean variation = 2.1.</p>

<p>Since both these figures represent an effect usually explained by
optical illusion, that factor may be counted out, and the difference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
in the estimate be accounted for by the difference in the rhythm
of the units. The difference in estimation between the two rhythmic
units, differing only in odd and even number of strips, is greater
than between the rhythmic and more strictly symmetrical, and yet
the two were more comparable in construction. It would seem,
then, that the greater overestimation of II is due to the rhythmic
movement which is not limited or driven back to a central line as in
I, but, by continuing over the limits, produces a greater feeling of
breadth.</p>

<p>The same question was experimented on in another way. Smaller
strips of cardboard all 50 mm. wide, but with different designs,
were hung behind the narrow window previously used. Four of each
set were hung at a time behind the window, and subjects arranged
them so that the interspaces appeared to equal the strips. These
designs were to illustrate different points in question. The difference
in estimation for an empty card, and a filled one; the difference according
to the strongly centred, or rhythmic, or slant lines of the
filling. These experiments were not so complete as the former ones,
since the subjects were scattered; hence they represent only one
trial or an average of two. But the results conform with what we
have been led to expect.</p>

<p>These results point to the fact that there is a tendency to overestimate
the strips unless there is a strong central accent, which
draws the attention back to the middle of the strip, in which case it
is slightly underestimated. This would seem to be contradicted in I,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
where the centre is strongly marked by slant lines coming toward it.
But the subjects, instead of taking the lines as pointing <em>towards</em> the
centre, in almost every case felt them as leading <em>away</em> from it, and
the oblique lines gave an appearance of greater breadth, which
result was carried out by the greater overestimation of II. In this
case, in addition to slant lines, there was no central accent, and the
overestimation was proportionately large. III and IV were intended
to illustrate the difference in estimate of rhythmic and symmetrical
units, but although a slight difference is apparent, the subjects did
not feel III as strongly rhythmic, because the black lines on the ends
of the strip were ignored against the black background, and only
the two central lines were taken. This made it more a balanced than
a rhythmic unit, so it is not a fair type of the point in question.</p>

<p>We may say, in conclusion, that oblique lines (which involve a
more complex muscular adjustment to perceive them) give an impression
of greater distance traversed, hence are overestimated; of
two rhythmic groups, the one containing an even number is more
overestimated than the odd, since the movement across is unchecked,
and not balanced around a central line; a series of strongly centred
groups is more correctly estimated as to its interspacing, and even
slightly underestimated, because of the check imposed by the centre
of fixation in each group. Although these results are very uniform,
a more complete series of experiments should be done on this subject,
to make the conclusions thoroughly valid.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img  src="images/i_230.jpg" alt="Fig 27" />
</div>

<p>Another question was suggested by these results: Is it more agreeable
to have a series of repeated space forms nearer or farther apart
when a design is within? Does the design, by drawing attention to
itself (especially if it be markedly central), make the objects demand
narrower or wider interspacing? To test this question, four blank
strips of cardboard were hung behind the narrow window, and the
subjects arranged them at the distance apart which suited them best.
Then two other sets of cards, of the same size, but of different designs,
were hung successively the same way, and these arranged also at the
most agreeable distances.
One decorated card had a
circle within a rectangle,
the other a triangle of gilt
stars. The judgments were
made in pairs, <em>i. e.</em> the blank
cards and the one with the circular design were arranged twice in
succession; then the blank cards and the star design. This gives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
three judgments for the blank cards, two for the circular, and one
for the star design, and the judgments are given in full, since an
average would disguise the point in question.</p>

<p>Although the favorite arrangements varied somewhat on the different
days, the <em>filled</em> cards were with only four exceptions preferred nearer
together than the <em>empty</em> ones at any one trial, and two of these put
them equal. (The choice of V. was affected by the fact that the circular
designs produced such strong after-images that he was obliged to
put them farther apart, to avoid confusion with the real design.) The
reason suggested by the subjects for a narrower interspacing with
decorated cards was that, when they attended to the design, they
paid no attention to the actual edge of the card, but the card ended
so far as its interest was concerned with the design. Therefore they
had to be nearer together to bring the <em>designs</em>, not the whole field
of the cards, into a series. If, then, the design extended over all the
card, and its interest was no more in the centre than the ends, would
this difference in interspacing cease to be demanded?</p>

<p>Another series of cards was hung with a design of oblique lines
over the whole field, and these arranged as the others were, at the
most agreeable distances.</p>

<p>If, for the sake of comparison, the average be taken of the favorite
arrangements of the four blank cards, and they compared with the
interspacing of the oblique line design, it
will be seen they approach each other
closely, except in the case of W.</p>

<p>These experiments would seem to show
that an empty space, or one completely
covered with decoration, is taken in its
entirety when repeated in the series. But when decorated, especially
toward the centre, the <em>design</em>, instead of the whole including space,
is taken as the repeated unit, and for this reason the different units
must approach each other to make a satisfactory series.</p>

<p>To what extent does change in <em>level</em> and <em>plane</em> affect the units of
a series? To test this, a series of diamond shapes was hung on the
same level and at equal distances, and the subjects enjoyed them as
a repeated series.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img  src="images/i_232b.jpg" alt="Fig 29" />
</div>

<p>Then another row was hung above them, and halfway between.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img  src="images/i_232c.jpg" alt="Fig 30" />
</div>

<p>The subjects grouped them either in twos or threes, thus transforming
them into one series of similar group-units of triplets and
pairs. They were asked if they could take them up and down, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
after the other without grouping, as they would have done when on
the same level. With a little practice two of them succeeded, but
they found the series tiresome when taken in this way, and deprived
of much of its pleasure.</p>

<p>The series was then changed by hanging a smaller diamond between
the others, at the same level.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img  src="images/i_233.jpg" alt="Fig 31 A Fig 31 B" />
</div>

<p>This was enjoyed even more than the other, as an alternating series,
but when the smaller diamond was hung between but on a higher level
although it could still be included if <em>grouped</em> in some way with one
or two of the larger diamonds, it baffled all attempts to include it as
an alternate minor unit in the other series. The two series separated,
and one ran along above the other, or else a definite grouping took
place, so that the large and small diamonds made one group-unit
which was repeated. But to combine two different elements as major
and minor units of one series, when the two were on different <em>levels</em>,
was generally declared impossible.</p>

<p>Provided units stay on the same level, however, a difference in
<em>plane</em> does not prevent their being in one series, provided the plane
varies regularly, and the variation is not too great. The variation in
plane of a few inches, used with these shapes, did not prevent their
being taken as one series, although it much facilitated their being
taken as two, if desired.</p>

<p>These experiments have all pointed to the fact that our pleasure
in repeated space forms is an immediate experience. We do not
look over the series and merely recognize that regular repetitions
occur, but there is an immediate <em>feeling</em> of repetition, analogous to
our feeling of auditory rhythm. This feeling does not always accompany<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
a recognition that certain repetitions occur, but is a distinct
experience in itself dependent upon certain conditions in the series.
The series excites a certain response in the observer, which, if it corresponds
with his rhythmic organization, is pleasant, and if not, is
otherwise.</p>

<p>With a certain class of subjects this rhythmic response is very
noticeable, and they feel it as a conscious part of the experience.
With others, the symmetrical properties of the series are the more
prominent, and they detect no rhythmic response until the necessary
objective conditions for such a rhythm are violated. Then they feel
it as keenly as the other type.</p>

<p>In a series of units, there is a rhythmic discharge of energy on
each, the fixed temporal intervals being regulated by the alternating
space. When the units are too near together, or when the alternating
spaces vary irregularly in size, this rhythm is disturbed. If the alternating
spaces vary regularly in size, a richer rhythm is introduced,
which increases the pleasure up to a certain point when more variation
makes it too complicated, and confusion results. When one
element alternates with another, the one on which more energy is
expended for any reason becomes the principal unit. The other
has less significance as to its content than as to its size, for on this
depends the regularity of the rhythm. Variations in the content of
alternating figures must be cautious not to disturb, by the extra attention
necessary to take them in, the rhythm of the whole. Variation
in the principal unit may take place almost without limit, provided
there is an equal amount of interest in each, thus making a rhythm
of equal discharges. There must be an alternation of <em>two</em>, <em>i. e.</em> of discharge
of attention and rest. However rich the rhythm is made by
greater and lesser accents or groupings, the rhythm must fall eventually
into a discharge of attention, and a rest-period. In the temporal
type of subject, to whom the actual <em>motion</em> across the series is a
necessary factor of the pleasure, this discharge and rest-period of
<em>attention</em> is exactly inverse to the <em>motion</em> across the alternate and
rest upon the unit. That is, on the principal unit is the discharge of the
attention, but the rest-period of the motion across; while the alternate
unit supplies the field which is travelled over, but requires but little
attention.</p>

<p>The rhythm of the series may be not only of the units, but inside
the units as well, in groups of elements. The rhythm inside such a
group may be of two kinds: (1) a rhythm, which is at the same time
restrained and coÃ¶rdinated about a central point or line, and (2) a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
rhythm which goes back and forth from edge to edge, and has a
tendency to overstep its limits, thereby carrying on the series with
more activity. The former is more connected with odd-number
groups, and the latter with even, although modifications in their
arrangement may reverse the effect. Since the eye moves more slowly
and intricately over a curve than over a straight line,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> it may be that
that is the reason why an arched series is taken as the unit of a series,
rather than the vertical supports (as it invariably is in some unfinished
experiments not recorded here), whereas in a series of lintels
the horizontal line of the lintels requires less muscular adjustment
to perceive it than the vertical support, therefore the latter are taken
as the units.</p>

<p>In any case, the unit of the series which attracts the most attention
and interest, for whatever reason, is taken as the principal unit, and
may vary in details, while the alternate must be invariable, except in
certain cases where it meets other demands. There may be rhythm
in a series, and at the same time symmetry with respect to a middle
point. In such a case a balance must be obtained between the two
different motor responses.</p>

<p>A series of analogies between the rhythm of sounds and of visual
objects, will illustrate more forcibly the similar demands of both.</p>

<p>(1) Auditory Rhythm: Periodicity is necessary. Accentuation
may be supplied by the subject, but there must be fixed temporal intervals,
and if the temporal conditions are not fulfilled, no impression
of rhythm is possible.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>Visual Repetition: Alternate spaces must be of invariable size, or
the series is broken up. Different degrees of interest may attach to
the principal unit, or the subject may group them in different ways,
but the alternate spaces must be uniform, or there is no feeling of
rhythmic repetition.</p>

<p>(2) Auditory Rhythm: Sounds must recur within a certain rate.
When succession falls below, or rises above a certain rate, no impression
of rhythm results.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> A certain voluminousness is necessary
for very slow measures, to make the separate elements connect themselves
in a series.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>Visual Repetition: Objects must recur at certain proportionate
distances from each other, to connect themselves into a series. Larger
objects may be at a greater distance from each other than smaller
ones, and still form a series.</p>

<p>(3) Auditory Rhythm: "Perception of rhythm is an impression,
an immediate affection of consciousness, depending on a particular
kind of sensory experience. It is never a construction or reflective
perception that certain relations of intensity, duration, etc., do obtain."<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>Visual Repetition: The feeling of rhythm in a visual series is
immediate, and wholly distinct from the knowledge that certain
objects do recur. This is especially illustrated in repetitions of three
distinct units, when subjects saw and understood the scheme of
repetition, but could not feel it.</p>

<p>(4) The number of units in an auditory group depends on the
rate of succession, but any higher number of elements in a group
than <em>six</em> or <em>eight</em> falls back into smaller groups.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> <em>Eight</em> is about the
highest number that can be held in a rhythmic group.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>Visual Repetition: <em>Eight</em> is the highest number that can be held in
a rhythmic group, and some subjects can only hold seven. Many
more units can be felt in a group, when the size of the including space
is taken as the measure and compared; but no more than eight
can be felt and recognized as the number of units it is. (There may
be exceptions to this rule in either auditory or visual rhythm, but
this is the norm in both cases.)</p>

<p>(5) Auditory Rhythm: In all long series, there is a subordination
of the higher rhythmic quantities, so that opposition of simple alternate
phases tends more and more to predominate over triplicated
structures.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>Visual Repetition: However complicated the repetition becomes,
with regular variations of the size of major or alternate units, the
units tend to re-group themselves, and so resolve ultimately into a
simple alternate repetition of two group-elements.</p>

<p>(6) Auditory Rhythm: "The introduction of variations in the
figure of a group does not in any way affect the sense of equivalence
between the unlike units."<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>Visual Repetition: Changes in the content of the major unit do
not affect the repetition provided the alternate space remains invariable.</p>

<p>(7) "Feeling of rhythm is more definite as we proceed in a verse,
or in a series of simple sound sensations. At first the cycle is not
perfectly adjusted, and complete automatism established."<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>Visual Repetition: Observers often had to look over a series
several times "to learn it" as they said, before the rhythm was felt.</p>

<p>To these may be added several other analogies, which, owing to the
fact that visually repeated objects remain in the field, while auditory
rhythm is purely successive, have other features which somewhat
confuse the resemblance. The principle, however, is the same in both.</p>

<p>(8) Auditory Rhythm: "At the close of a period, we have a pause,
during which the tension between the two opposing muscle-sets dies
out, and we have a feeling of finality."<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>Visual Repetition: An alternating series must end on the heavy
unit, but since one does not look at series from left to right any more
than from right to left, a heavy unit must be at both ends, not on
one alone. In auditory rhythm, this final pause is not a function of
any of the intervals of the period, for it comes at the end, when the
sounds are no more present. But in visual repetition, after feeling
the series rhythmically, it is still in the field, either as an unending
series, or as a whole, in which each part is equally related to all the
others. The final pause of a series that ends must be at <em>each</em> end,
and the series perfect from either point of view. It therefore fulfils
the demands of symmetry as well as rhythm, but since symmetry in
its strict sense has no meaning for sound-series, this double finality
of visual repetition cannot be analogued in auditory rhythm.</p>

<p>(9) I have found no recorded experiments of rhythms of sounds
of different timbre and pitch, <em>i. e.</em>, a regular rhythm of a bell with a
violin, a piano with a whistle, etc. It would seem, however, that such
a succession would produce the same irritation as a visual repetition
of incongruous elements; as a circle introduced into the Greek fret, or
a series of Renaissance columns and Egyptian monoliths. In both
cases, the whole set of adjustments for each element would be thrown
into confusion by encountering the next one, which would require
a different attitude. Such a readjustment would be impossible in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
space necessary for the perception of any rhythm, hence there must
be congruity in elements, either auditory or visual, to be in a series
at all.</p>

<p>(10) Auditory Rhythm: "If every alternate element of a temporally
uniform sound-series receive increased stress, the interval
which succeeds the unaccented sound will appear of greater duration."<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>Visual Repetition: The distance between unit groups with a
strongly accented centre appeared shorter than between rhythmic
groups where the movement was not restrained at the centre, but
went from edge to edge. The principles which explain these similarities
are, however, different.</p>

<p>In the auditory rhythm, the stronger accented beat excites a greater
response than the unaccented. This lasts over longer in consciousness,
and for that reason the interval after the accent seems shorter.</p>

<p>In visual rhythm, however, the symmetrically rhythmic group
drives the attention in toward the centre, and whatever excursion it
makes to either side, it returns finally to the centre. In the even-number
rhythmic group, there is no such central line to restrain it, and as
one goes across it one has less check at the edge, the rhythm does not
wholly finish, and the space is thereby overestimated. The <em>overestimation</em>
is due to the rhythmic activity in the group which oversteps
its limit.</p>

<p>The essentially rhythmic character of the experience is, however,
the same in both. The experience of visual repetition is only one-sided
when the symmetry or proportion of a finished series is regarded
as the explanation of its essential character, and when the temporal
rhythmic factor is neglected.</p>


<h3>P<span class="smcapa">ART</span> II</h3>

<p>The purpose of the latter half of this discussion of repetition is
to consider a certain number of examples of its use in typical
buildings of all the European styles of architecture from Greece
down, and to show that the principles laid down in the earlier half
have been expressed almost without exception in those of recognized
merit. In other words it is to show that the laws of repetition,
which have been brought out in the experiments of the first
part, and which would of necessity be true if that explanation were
correct, have indeed been exemplified in types of architecture universally
accepted as beautiful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<p>The illustrations have all been drawn from architecture beginning
with Greece, and not from the older Eastern styles. Egyptian
architecture, although it recognized the importance of repetition
to some extent, in its colonnades, avenues of sphinxes, and hieroglyphic
decoration, never reduced it to any principle, nor adhered to
any one scheme throughout a piece of work. Supports of the same
kind and diameter have no fixed relation to each other, they may
be of the same or different lengths, and may vary in diameter as
well.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> Spaces between columns of one size and design may vary
considerably, and the entablatures be of different proportions. The
art of Egypt was not rhythmic.</p>

<p>The architecture of Assyria and Chaldea had even less of repeated
forms in its style. They made but little use of columns or
piers, and had few arches.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> The bare Assyrian edifice was like a
great box, perpendicular to its foundations, and the long walls pierced
by hardly an opening in the way of windows or doors.</p>

<p>Persian architecture was noted for extreme nicety of execution,
but a monotony in all its forms, and conventionality about its use
of the column, which makes it little more fruitful for our study of
repetition as an artistic value. In its decorations of bas-relief, the
pose and gesture of each figure is so exactly similar that they appear
almost machine-made.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> When a little variety is introduced,
it is evidently done with misgivings, and shows none of the spontaneity
or first-hand pleasure in either repetition or variation which
would make it profitable for illustration.</p>

<p>Such a lack of feeling for repetition is, indeed, according to the
peculiar genius of these styles of architecture, what might have
been expected. The ruling idea, especially in Egyptian and Assyrian
architecture, was ponderous strength. Everything was built
with the idea of remaining immoveable through centuries to come.
The enormous temples and tombs, the long palaces with their heavy
walls without an opening to relieve them, the pyramids themselves
like mountains of rock&mdash;all these meant strength and immutability,
to which the motion and rhythm involved in repetition was totally
foreign in spirit. In Persia indeed (as well as India and China,
which will not be considered here) there was a change in tone.
The column was used, not the massive one of Egypt, but a lighter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
shaft, which showed a tendency toward other effects than immensity
and strength.</p>

<p>With this change of ideal, repetition in some kind of system made
its appearance, but its variations were tentative. It had not become
used to its new sense, and it was left for Greece to develop the
rhythm and movement of repetition, and to combine it with proportion
and symmetry into its perfection.</p>

<p>The method of analysis employed has been to go through a certain
number of architectural photographs, picking out all the examples
of repeated forms of any description, and classifying them
according to the principles which they exemplified or seemed to
violate. For this purpose a collection of about five thousand photographs
from the library of Robinson Hall, Harvard University,
was analyzed. The photographs were taken in order of styles: Greek,
Roman, Romanesque, Gothic, Italian and French Renaissance,
and modern. The examples of the different points in question were
taken as they came in the cataloguing of the library stacks, without
respect to whether they appeared to bear out the previous conclusions
or not.</p>


<p class="p2b">V<span class="smcapa">ARIATION</span> <span class="smcapa">OF</span> A<span class="smcapa">LTERNATING</span> U<span class="smcapa">NITS</span></p>

<p>The first principle which we shall consider is the variation allowable
in the units of an alternating series. It will be remembered
that the principle was as follows: (1) In any series of two alternating
units, the one on which the most energy is expended is regarded
as the principal unit, the less important one as an alternate.
Variation of the principal unit is allowable, often desirable
and even necessary; variation of the alternate never allowable,
unless other circumstances change the situation. If the minor unit
is changed, so that in interest it equals the major unit, the rest-phase
of the rhythm is destroyed, the effect is of two rival repetitions going
along together, and fatigue results. If variation in the alternates
exceeded that of the principal units, the balance of the rhythm
would change, the alternate become the major unit, and a new series
begin.</p>

<p>From the very nature of the case, then, it will be impossible to
look for variations in alternates, which make it exceed the principal
units in interest. We must investigate alternating series, in
order to see if <em>one of the elements remains the same</em>, while the other
may or may not vary. If this were true, a rest-phase for the rhythm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
would be assured in the series, while the principal unit might vary,
provided the same amount of attention were required in each case.
(2) It will also be remembered that <em>size</em> and <em>limiting shape</em> were the
factors that could not vary without doing violence to the rhythm,
while content might vary almost without restriction. (3) The position
of alternating units as regards each other cannot vary; the two
units are so dependent on each other that the position of one must
remain halfway between two of the opposite kind. In other words,
if the two series of units run between each other, they form <em>one</em>
series or rhythm. Two rhythms cannot be kept up alongside; so if
one unit, however regularly placed with regard to another of its
own kind, recurs at unequal distances from the <em>other</em> units, the
feeling of the repetition is lost, the rhythm broken, unless the two
units can be grouped into one, and so make a single rhythm again.</p>

<p>We shall, then, look for alternating series, of which the two units
are at <em>equal</em> and <em>invariable</em> distances from each other; the variations
of content (if such there are) occur only in the major unit; and are
of the filling, not of the including shape or size.</p>

<p>It may be readily seen that there are difficulties in finding alternating
series which exactly illustrate this particular point, or in reducing
them to any system. It was necessary to look through many
photographs to find one that presented the required conditions
(<em>i. e.</em>, two repeated series of units, alternating with each other), and
when found, they were of so many different varieties, from windows
in an apse to reliefs on a fountain, that each has had to be described
by itself, and any rigid classification was impossible. Moreover, it
was difficult to find a scale of judgment by which to decide whether
a series was really alternating or plain repetition. From one point
of view, <em>every</em> repetition is alternating, that is, the repeated unit
always alternates with an empty space. Although such repetitions
bear out the theory still further, and emphasize yet more strongly
the invariability of alternates, and the possibility of variations in
the principal units, I have used the term in a stricter sense, and
only given illustrations of repeated objects, when one unit actually
alternated with another definite unit.</p>

<p>Had the other sense of the term been used, examples might have
been multiplied without limit, of slightly varying repeated units,
and unvarying alternate blank spaces. But it was felt that such
accumulation of illustration was unnecessary, and that what was
true in a stricter sense of the term would be recognized as true for
the larger number of cases that might be cited with a wider meaning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
If the minor units had a definite enclosing outline, they were counted
even though they were blank within, but without an enclosing outline,
that is, if they were mere spaces, they were not considered, although
the fact that there is such universal use of this type of decoration
shows only more conclusively how the necessity of the invariability
of alternates is taken for granted as an axiom of design.</p>

<p>Another type of alternate repetition was not included in the illustrations,
<em>i. e.</em>, when two sets of units alternated, <em>without variation
in either one</em>. To this class belong all the conventionalized designs
used so much in all kinds of decoration, and of which a very full
account is given in Owen Jones's Grammar of Ornament.</p>

<p>These, to be sure, illustrate the negative points, viz., that size
and shape are unalterable for rhythmic repetition; that distances must
be equal and invariable; and that alternate units must not vary.
But since the principal units do not vary either, it seemed needless
to give them as examples of the point in question. A mention of this
class of alternating repetitions, of which there is such a great number,
is enough to show that they fall within the theory. But one example
is as good as a thousand, and their inclusion among the illustrations
for rhythmic alternates will be taken for granted without further
mention.</p>

<p>We are left, then, to the consideration of those alternating repetitions
alone, where both have a definite outline, and one or both
varies to a greater or lesser extent. The effort will be to show that
the unit which for some reason is of principal importance in the
rhythm, is the one chosen to vary, and if not that the repetition
suffers thereby.</p>

<p>The 125 illustrations of alternating repetition which were taken
at random among 5000 photographs show a decided compliance
with the principles already laid down. But there are many divergences
as well, which it is necessary to consider, to see whether they
are really contrary in principle or fall under its wider application.
Eighty-two accord exactly with the principles with which we started.
The distances between each set of units are equal and invariable;
one unit varies in content but not in size or including shape; the alternating
unit is invariable.</p>

<p>There is an interesting modification of this principle in the case
of the metopes and triglyphs of the Greek friezes. Here the triglyphs
are unquestionably the principal units structurally, and to
many observers the principal beat of the rhythm when taken rhythmically.
But the triglyphs never vary and the metopes do, which would
seem at first to violate the rule that principal units alone, and not
alternates, should vary. This difficulty is obviated in two ways. With
the spatial type of observer, the triglyph is indeed the principal beat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
of the rhythm when the series is at such a distance that the difference
in the metopes (if there is such) cannot be detected. When,
however, the series is nearer at hand, there ceases to be any rhythm,
but each carved relief is taken for itself without regard to the others.
With the rhythmic type of observer, if the triglyph has been the
principal unit before, the principal beat changes on nearer approach
to the metope and the whole series shifts its accent. It is impossible
for any observer to keep the triglyph as the principal unit of the
rhythm, when so near that differences in the metope are easily perceived.</p>

<p>There are still thirty-eight cases which vary from these rules, and
many of them vary in more than one respect. These exceptions
fall into several classes, quite distinctly marked off from one another,
and will be taken up in turn.</p>

<p>In five cases, the <em>size</em> of the principal unit varies as well as the content,
but in four cases the variation of size is either at each end, or
in the centre unit, to emphasize bilateral symmetry of the series as a
whole. The series in this case is taken as a larger unity of which the
separate units are parts; and hence they are not only repeated with
respect to themselves, but are symmetrical with respect to the whole.
In the other case where the size of the principal unit varies, it varies
on <em>every other one</em>, thereby complicating but not confusing the rhythm,
<em>i. e.</em>, a stronger accent comes on every other principal unit.</p>

<p>There are also five cases in which the alternate spaces vary in size.
Three vary regularly, thereby enriching the rhythm by introducing
alternate heavy beats, and one varies at each end of the series to
emphasize bilateral symmetry of the whole, with regard to the central
unit. In the other case the alternates vary in both shape and size,
with no regularity and from the point of view of repetition alone,
disorder is all that results. This is on the Palazzo Pretoria in Pistoia,
where carved shields occur at equal distances between windows.
These shields are not component parts of the building, but were
added with some other kind of significance; hence they express nothing
so far as repetition for its own sake is concerned.</p>

<p>The other variations are all in the <em>content</em> of the alternate, minor
space. Four vary <em>symmetrically</em> in the designs on each side of the
central point, so as to accent the bilateral symmetry of the whole
taken as a unity. Two vary rhythmically in design, <em>i. e.</em>, there are
two sets of designs which alternate with each other in the unaccented
spaces. When they vary regularly in design, the rhythm of the
whole is <em>enriched</em> not confused, provided there are only <em>two</em> sets, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
three or more. The alternate spaces are passed over on the way to the
principal unit, but by having an alternating design between them
(varying only in detail, but of the same general character) a more
complex rhythm is introduced which is good, since in both cases the
alternates and principal units are so different they could not possibly
be confused with each other, even though both varied. (In one case,
turrets and statues vary with windows of the same shape but different
decorations; in the other, arched windows and arched spaces alternate
with statues.)</p>

<p>Eleven more cases of variation in the minor as well as major spaces
fall under another head. These do not vary with regularity, but are
different in each case&mdash;the detail of the design varying, while
the shape, size, and distance remain unchanging. It is interesting
to notice that these examples of variations of alternates were almost
all taken from examples of Renaissance architecture, where
a richness of effect was desired, even at the expense of regular rhythm.
This could, indeed, be attained in no other way so well as this. In
all these eleven cases, the conditions are alike: both of the repeated
units are enclosed by limiting lines of unchanging outline. The
principal units are more prominent than the others on account of
greater size or interest, but the alternates, instead of retiring entirely
into the background, have slight variations in decoration. This variation
is always only in detail: the tracery on the pillars of the tomb
of Louis XII, of the Loggia dei Novoli, in the Chiesi di Frari, Venice,
etc. So unimportant in fact is the variation that it is not observed
until one attends closely to it, and yet the rhythm is just enough disturbed
by its presence to give a feeling of <em>extra sensation</em> or <em>luxuriance</em>
which cannot be attained through variation of the major units
alone. It is in the alternate spaces that the <em>feeling</em> of repetition lies.
Any material change in them destroys the series, but a slight variation
in the lines of decoration, a little rearrangement of the conventional
curves in each alternate, gives, even though unattended to, in
fact partly <em>because</em> unattended to, a vague feeling of variety, of some
superfluous sensation being brought into consciousness, although
the regular shape, size, and distance of the objects remains unchanged.
It is this feeling of superfluity and slight disturbance which constitutes
the peculiar richness of certain styles. These examples, then,
far from falling outside of the laws of repetition, owe their opulence
of sensations to the very principles of regular rhythm which they
violate.</p>

<p>Another set of exceptions will involve more searching analysis.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
Nine of the examples described have the human form for the alternate
unit, and in every case where this happens, the alternate varies.
In the majority of cases where statues of the human form alternate
with any other object, the statue is taken as the principal unit on
account of its superior interest, but this is not always the case. In
the Padua Basilica, and in the Church of St. Guistiana, cherubs alternate
with conventional decorations, but the latter are so much larger
and more elaborate that they would naturally be taken as the principal
units. In the other seven cases, statues alternate with bas-reliefs which
also have human figures in them; hence, since the bas-reliefs equal
the statues in interest and exceed them in size and importance, they
are taken as principal units.</p>

<p>It might at first be expected from the previous discussion that, in
order not to shatter the repetition, the alternate statues must be
alike, must be conventionalized into identity; but this is not the
case. Another principle now comes into play. We demand variation
in the human form whatever its place in art, even in the unimportant
position of alternate in a repetition, and although they are kept as
much alike in pose, size, level of head and feet, general character
(<em>i. e.</em>, cherubs do not alternate with old men, nor draped figures with
undraped), yet there is some variation of pose or direction of glance,
to keep them from being duplicates. We should expect this variety
of repetition to be in danger of becoming fatiguing because of its
lack of an unchanging rest-phase, but this difficulty was evidently felt
in building them, for in every case <em>some unchanging element</em> has been
supplied to the series to bind it together and to keep the constant
changes of attention from upsetting the series. The cherubs of the
Padua Basilica are in high relief against a uniform rectangular
background which does not vary, and which furnishes an alternate
just in character with the principal unit, the bas-relief. In the
Cantoria of Donatello, although the dancing children move across
the whole space, uniform double columns occur at intervals, and
supply an unchanging alternate, while the children vary in position
behind them. Around the pulpit of Lincoln Cathedral, although
both units, reliefs, and statues vary, the pilasters behind the statues
are invariable and supply a constant, unchanging factor in the series.
In the alternating reliefs and statues of the Milan Cathedral or in
the paintings of different sizes in All Souls Church, Oxford, an
unchanging element is supplied in the frame, which is of like design
in every case, so that in passing from one to the other an unvarying
alternate is always present. In the Sienna font, and in the statue to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
Leonardo da Vinci, which are types of a vast quantity of repeated
forms, there is uniformity in the minor pedestals and in the frames
of the alternating bas-reliefs, which supplies the unchanging factor.</p>

<p>Moreover, another factor is noticeable in this kind of repeated
series,&mdash;it is never long. The fatigue which would certainly result
from a too long continuance of varied alternates, even with unvarying
factors in the way of supports, pillars, and frames, is obviated in
various ways. The series is either short and the whole has a definite
bilateral symmetry, as in the Padua Basilica, and in the Oxford
church; or, as in a great number of cases, the series goes around
a fixed central point so that only three units are seen at a time. It is
thus especially that this method is used in fonts, pulpits, and monuments,
where from the circular arrangement enough can never be
brought into the field at once to fatigue the attention.</p>

<p>This consideration of alternates which vary widely, as do human
figures, even when they are alike in size, general shape, and character,
and, moreover, the discovery that there is almost without exception
an invariable element <em>between</em> the other alternating units, <em>i. e.</em>, a third
alternate; or <em>behind</em> them, as in the case of the pilaster behind the
statue, may well bring up two questions:</p>

<p>(1) When the unchanging factor comes <em>between</em> the other two units,
is not <em>it</em> in reality the alternate, and the two other units either variations
of shape and size of one principal unit or two sets of principal
units? In other words, do we not actually apperceive the two principal
objects as the units of importance, and take the unvarying factor
which comes between, no matter how slight it may be, as the alternate?
Do we not demand the unvarying as our alternate, no matter how
many variations may be in the other figures?</p>

<p>(2) When the unchanging factor comes <em>behind</em> the alternating
statue, in the same plane with the bas-relief, do we not inevitably
take <em>it</em> as the alternate in the series, and regard the statues more as
episodes or attendants on the series but with real values of their
own? Is not the fact that the unvarying factor and principal units are
in the same plane an indication that they constitute a real series,
while the statues or paintings which are in a plane by themselves
make a series, harmonizing with the other, it is true, and in part coinciding
with it, but felt in a different way? Therefore the actual
repeated series conforms to the given conditions and is made to do so
in every case by its unchanging alternate in the same plane; while
human figures with values of their own never can be considered
quite as alternates, but are really felt to be a series by themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<p>This introduces another question. In two more cases of varying
alternates, there was variation in decoration above the level of the
rest of the series. In the Borghese Casino, there is variation in the
busts placed <em>over</em> the alternate windows. In the Venice rood-screens,
there is variation in the carving of the alternating supports, which
rise <em>above</em> the rest of the series. Is that part of the series above the
level of the principal units really included in its perception? It would
seem rather that when the series as a whole is being taken, those
variations above the level of the main units (if they are not very
marked, and they were not in either of these two cases) are ignored
or only felt in a vague way as added richness. When, however, the
attention is turned toward them especially, they form a series of their
own, in which they become the principal units, and alternate with
empty spaces. There is no limit to the changes possible in apperception,
according to the <em>level</em> and <em>plane</em> of the alternating units.</p>

<p>There are three cases left; two where alternates vary in content
with no system, and one with variation in distance. The first two
are differently carved sections of railing on the side of Freiburg
Cathedral, and a differently decorated frieze of squares and circles
in the S. Lorenzo Cloisters, Rome. The effect is only of disconnected
and fragmentary series in both cases, and especially in the latter
case it is impossible to feel it as a repetition at all unless the variations
are ignored, and the attention fixed on the unvarying factor of size.</p>

<p>The variation of distance is in the Beauvais Palais de Justice,
where the first window is at an unequal distance from the others in
the series. The effect is only of disorder and accident.</p>

<p>We have, then, surveyed all our examples of alternate repetition,
and found that in the exceptions to the general principles laid down
some other effect than repetition as such was sought. Either (1) symmetry
for the series as a unity was required, which demanded variation
of the end or central units. In so far, then, as it fulfilled the
requirements of symmetry, those of repetition were disregarded.</p>

<p>(2) Richness of effect was accomplished by those slight variations
in decoration of alternates as well as the principal units. These by
their vague suggestions of different combinations of similar elements,
and minor differences felt but not attended to, gave a superfluity of
experience which made up its peculiar richness.</p>

<p>(3) When the human form (or any other form of especial meaning
in itself) makes the alternate unit, some variation is demanded as
in keeping with its own significance, since in proportion as a thing
has meaning in itself, it must not be exactly duplicated. But an invariable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
alternate is always supplied in the way of a frame, or background,
which is felt as the real rest-phase of the rhythm, while the
varying alternate forms have a place in a series of their own. Also,
since such a complex attitude would be fatiguing, such series are
always short, or circular, so that few units are in the field at once.</p>

<p>(4) Regular variations in size or content, in either major or minor
which recur at fixed intervals, give a heightened rhythmical effect
by making certain beats heavier than the rest. As has been stated
before, the major unit holds within it the real significance of the
<em>content</em> of the experience; the minor unit holds the secret of the
<em>rhythmic</em> effect.</p>

<p>(5) Only 4 examples of the 125 were found to repeat themselves
alternately with irregular variation of alternates and violation of
the other principles laid down at the start. These can only be regarded
as accidents, as faulty examples of art, whose virtue lies in
some other part of the work as a whole, and not by any beauty they
possess in themselves as repeated series.</p>

<p>Several questions have been raised in this discussion of variations,
but one which seems directly leading from it will be considered next.</p>

<p>When is variation <em>necessary</em> in a repeated series? We have considered
the numerous cases where variation is <em>possible</em>, and the different
ways in which a series may vary according to the idea to be expressed.
Moreover, what appeared to be exceptions to the rule were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
shown to be guided by a desire for some other effect than repetitions
as such.</p>

<p>But when do we demand variation in a series? Is there any case
where variation of the unit is not only allowable, but positively
necessary to its Ã¦sthetic value?</p>

<p>There were no experiments on this question, for it will be seen
from what follows that they would have been impracticable. But
observation of several thousand photographs has made the following
clear: When the series consists of objects having an Ã¦sthetic
significance of their own, not depending on something else for their
value, then variation is demanded. In other words, when a thing
is an end in itself, we do not tolerate an <em>exact</em> duplicate. It may
have a place in a series of others similar to it, but its own meaning
loses force if another is beside it precisely alike. When, however,
an object has no great significance by itself, or when however great
its value, it be regarded as means to something greater, hence not
an end in itself, it may be repeated without variation.</p>

<p>This principle may be stated from another point of view: Any
work of art, of the <em>highest</em> significance in itself alone, must not be
repeated at all. There must not be even the suggestion of repetition.
The highest values are individual, and to have a copy or a series
defeats its whole reason for being. Thus, a second Sistine Madonna,
or a series of Venuses, would shock our whole Ã¦sthetic feeling.
Moreover, we do not want a <em>suggestion</em> of repetition; even a series
of different Madonnas in similar frames would take away from the
significance of each, in so far as they were regarded as a series, and
not as a mere collection of detached units.</p>

<p>But grading down from these works of the highest value in art,
there comes a point where an object, although possessing considerable
value in itself, is not so intensely individual but that it can gain
somewhat by a place in a series of others like it <em>in some respects</em>, but
differing enough so that each still keeps its own meaning distinct
from the rest.</p>

<p>The balance between these two artistic aims, <em>i. e.</em>, the significance
of the unit, and the rhythm of the series, must be adjusted with great
nicety, and certain principles obtain wherever such series are found.
It would be useless to cite the numberless cases where such series
occur. Many have already been given in the examples of statues of
saints, paintings on altar-pieces, and reliefs alternating with statues.
One such series is a type of all. The human form represents that
which has the most significance in itself, so when it is used in a rhythmic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
series, its individuality must be toned down and conventionalized;
it must have no marked feature in one unit that does not appear in
another; the head and feet must be on the same level, or vary with
regularity; the general character and spirit of all must be similar,
but never identical.</p>

<p>The reducing to a common type is the demand of the rhythmic
series; the difference in attitude and arrangement of detail is the
demand of the unit.</p>

<p>Thus, the subjects chosen for repetition of this kind are in the
majority of cases apostles and saints, whose spirit and general conception
are the same; typical representations of abstract qualities,
such as Virtue, Courage, etc.; or conventionalized cherubs, and
even animals. As has been stated before, a long series of this kind
is impossible without fatigue. In proportion as the object is repeated
the individual units lose their own meaning, and they must have
their individuality definitely toned down and conventionalized to
avoid the clash between the two artistic values. Yet their essential
peculiarity must always be maintained, for we refuse to admit or
allow the total identity of any expression of living values, especially
as expressed in the human form.</p>

<p>It may be urged that statues are often arranged at regular intervals
around a building, where the effect of repetition is distinct,
and yet each statue is distinctly valuable for itself. But a distinction
must be insisted upon. The statues form a repeated series as regards
uniformity in position, height, pedestal, and color, so that the direct
sensuous effect may be called rhythmic. But as the attention fastens
on each for itself and takes it for its own meaning, it ceases to be part
of a series at all, but becomes a unit in a world of its own.</p>

<p>But what of the cases where the human form is repeated in a
series, and does not vary? Examples of this are rare, but they do
occur, and are interesting, since they throw light on what has been
already said. In the whole collection of photographs only two were
found where a series of identical statues of the human form occurred,&mdash;<em>The
Porch of the Maidens</em> in the Erectheum of Athens, and the
<em>Baths of the Forum</em> in Pompeii. In the former case the left knee of
the caryatids on the right of the centre, and the right knee of those
on the left of it, are raised a little; but aside from this slight variation
the six statues are exactly alike. In the latter case a row of titans
all around the interior bear the ceiling on their uplifted forearms
and are all alike. These two examples are very perfect of their kind,
and, far from offending us, are very satisfactory. The reason is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
obvious. In both cases the statues are not the Ã¦sthetic end in themselves,
but are there for a purpose, namely, that of a support. They
are not ends but means to something else, and as soon as we feel
<em>that</em> in regard to any work which would otherwise be of individual
significance, it ceases to be individual, or to demand a peculiar expression
different from all others, but may be duplicated without
offence. Therefore, since the support of the superstructure obviously
is dependent on the maidens in the one case and on the giants
in the other, and since instead of existing simply for their own value
they are there to hold up the roof, their artistic significance changes
at once from <em>ends</em> to <em>means</em>, and variation is not required. Moreover,
it will be found in the majority of cases that we demand this
invariability in actual supports. Although we find but these two cases
where caryatids are actually identical, we find also that in most cases
the caryatids do not really uphold the weight, but a pillar or pier
behind them supplies the real architectural support, and, that although
they have a place in front of the pillar and give an apparent
assistance in bearing the weight of the roof, yet the eye is not deceived.
We see that the work is really done by the pillar behind them, so
they that resume their place as artistic ends demanding variation,
and not as means to something else. The following examples were
found:</p>

<p><em>Milan. Arca di S. Pietro Martire.</em> Pillars uphold the arch while
four statues of women stand just in front. The pillars bear the weight
although the statues add strength to the whole. The statues are
varied.</p>

<p><em>Dijon. House of Caryatids.</em> Piers behind the caryatids give real
supports to the roof, while the figures added for decoration are all
varied.</p>

<p><em>Dresden. Zwinger.</em> Conventionalized figures ending at the waist
are put on the outside of unvarying piers which bear the actual weight
of the superstructure. The figures are all varied, but they cannot
be conceived as really bearing the strain, since they have no foundation,
but are merely added to the pier as a decoration.</p>

<p><em>Rouen. Tomb of Duc de BrezÃ©.</em> Four caryatids, all different, under
four jutting projections of the arch. These projections are built securely
into the rest of the structure and do not depend in the slightest
on the figures for support. The figures are not integral parts of the
whole architecturally, for the arch would stand exactly as well if
they walked away, which indeed they are apparently in the act of
doing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Toulouse. Hotel de la Borde.</em> Two caryatids under jutting projections
of a window. The projections are securely built into the
lintel and no weight rests on the caryatids nor even appears to. They
are there solely as decorations and are different.</p>

<p><em>Paris. Hotel de Ville.</em> Two caryatids under jutting projection of
a window, again. Here is a very slight variation of the two female
figures. The position of each is reversed to accent the symmetry
of the whole. Very little weight is actually borne by them, but more
than in the former cases, and we find proportionately less variation
in the figures. They approach identity, but there is variation in detail.</p>

<p>These were the main instances found of the point in question,
and are a type of the other minor ones found in support of pulpits,
choir-stalls, and windows. It will be seen that in no case but the two
classic ones given at the beginning are the human figures architecturally
necessary to the structures, and in these cases they do not
vary. In the other cases they are more or less playful, and the effect
of the whole would be very unsteady did the superstructure actually
depend upon them for support; but since piers rise invariably
behind them and bear the weight, they fall into the sphere of decoration
and from that point of view they must and do vary.</p>

<p>We have, then, considered variation of units in a repeated series,
where they may vary and where they must, and we find the real
value of repetition to appear in inverse proportion to the individual
significance of the separate units; the more interesting or expressive
the unit is in itself with individual significance, the less do we want
it repeated; and so repetition of the human form must be conventionalized
to the type (or to the same unvarying features), with
enough individual differences still remaining to meet the demands
both of the series and the individual. What apparent exceptions we
have found to this rule have been shown to be meeting, in reality,
another artistic demand.</p>


<p class="p6">E<span class="smcapa">NDS OF</span> S<span class="smcapa">ERIES AND</span> A<span class="smcapa">RRANGEMENT OF</span> R<span class="smcapa">EPETITIONS WITHIN
THE</span> U<span class="smcapa">NIT</span></p>

<p>The next question to consider is the <em>ends</em> necessary for a repeated
series. Do they end with a heavier or with a lighter unit than the
rest of the series, or with a unit of the same size? It will be remembered
in the experiments touching this point that the subjects, without
exception, preferred the series ending with heavier units. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
should then expect, in examples of repeated groups of posts, pillars,
etc., alternating with wider or more prominent ones of the same kinds,
that the series would end with the heavier or more prominent one.
Examples of railings or balustrades alternating with heavier supports
are so common, and the supports come so invariably on the
end, that repeated examples seem almost unnecessary. But another
question arose in connection with this: Does not the apperception
of a group of lines equidistant from each other consist in going back
and forth over them from edge to edge, with no rest on one point
more than on another; while in a group of lines arranged at equal
distances each side of the centre but not from each other, to emphasize
bilateral symmetry, does not the attention rest on the centre,
and move from the centre of one group to the next?</p>

<p>Moreover, we found that a wider space or embankment of some
sort was necessary, to finish off a series of groups in which the separate
lines were equidistant from each other, than to finish the groups
whose lines were symmetrically arranged. This suggests that the
activity which goes back and forth in the former case, being less
coÃ¶rdinated and not bound to a middle point, needs more at the end
to stop it than is needed in the latter case, when the attention is
more upon the centre of each figure. It would seem, then, that the former
arrangement would be appropriate for railings and balustrades,
where the effect is of continuity either running wholly around the
structure and into itself again or where a continuity of parts is desired
and a connected series. The other arrangement divides the
series into discrete parts. If the attention is stopped at every central
point, the effect is less of continuity and more of separate unities
bound together externally by their equal distances. We should, then,
expect such series of units much less in continuous balustrades,
but if they occurred at all, that they would be in connection with
separate unities that did not want continuity or place in a series
emphasized at the expense of their individuality. All this we might
expect from the experiments alone, although whether such a refinement
would have got into architecture seems questionable. Moreover,
the question whether a symmetrical group of units needs a less
heavy end to finish it than a group of the equidistant type is even
more difficult to illustrate. Although the two types may be given
under some conditions in experiments, in actual architecture they
never appear so, for the two types never appear in the same buildings
allowing them to be compared. Besides, few photographs are
taken exactly in front, and no two at just the same angle. Any accurate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
measurement of such end piers and any comparison of them
is out of the question in the present methods of research.</p>

<p>One other question may be considered here. Does a series ever
occur in which three units are repeated regularly, instead of one or
two? In experiments we discovered that the subject found it impossible
to feel repetitions of three in a series, and the only way that
such a series was tolerable was when the three could be grouped
somehow into one or two units. Therefore we should not expect to find
such repetitions frequently, if at all.</p>

<p>To sum up: Do series always end with a heavier unit? Are units
equally distant from each other more adapted to continuous or run-on
railings, while units with symmetrical arrangements within themselves
are found more often where separateness of objects enclosed
is more aimed at than their connection? Is a less heavy end found
after symmetrical series than after the other kind? Are repetitions
of three units used at all, and if so in what way?</p>

<p>Obviously the only illustrations of these questions will be found
in the arrangement of posts and pillars in balustrades of whatever
description. In these cases alone do we find repeated series, with
repetitions within the unit, as well as of the unit as a whole. The
following examples have been taken by looking over about one
thousand photographs and by recording every instance that occurred.</p>

<p>Having 100 illustrations of repetitions of groups, with units repeated
equidistantly between them, and of elements distinctly symmetrical,
several new factors came to light. In all the one thousand
photographs looked over, not a single instance was found of
unit-groups with the units within, arranged at other than equal distances.
There were many variations in the number of units in the
groups; but the number being given, the units were arranged at
equal distances from each other wherever the effect desired was of
detached sections or of continued series. There are obvious structural
reasons for this. Any repetition of groups for a balustrade or
protective railing, which is the almost exclusive use of this variety
of repetition, would be weakened by wider apertures on either side
of the centre. A reasonably enclosed space is necessary to make the
railing of value, therefore the specifically symmetrical unit as opposed
to the rhythmic unit was found always in carvings, scrolls,
bas-reliefs, etc., alternating with vertical supports. We should expect,
then, in general, that in railings where an aspect of continuity
of progress along some border or a tendency to go around an enclosure
was sought, the units would be rhythmic in character, impelling
one to motion and to carrying the eye and general organism out
of repose into movement. We should expect, on the contrary, that
symmetrical units would be found where repose or partial distinctness
of the separate elements enclosed was desired, and where the
attention was not to be carried away in so marked a degree. Seventy-three
of the one hundred illustrations were of balustrades where the
rhythmic factor was presumably aimed at.</p>

<p>The Rathaus at Braunschweig had a symmetrical design alternately
occurring, but with four in a section, so that the section as
a whole was not symmetrical and the attention was driven on, and
in the other cases some other effect than rhythm was obviously
aimed at. The genius of the structures was heavy and massive and
the balustrade made in keeping with them, since an effect of motion
or rhythm would have clashed with the spirit of the whole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<p>These examples have all been of the balustrades around enclosures,
balconies, etc. Since the rhythmic unit has been found more fitting
for them, we should expect, conversely, that in front of separate
unities, such as windows, doors, etc., the symmetrical unit would
be more in evidence. At first sight, the facts do not seem to bear
us out in this. Of twenty-seven examples of separate windows,
doors, and gates enclosed by railings, only four had distinctly symmetrical
designs. (Casa Palladio, Bergamo Chapel, Petit Trianon.)
These are wrought-iron designs in the centre with repeated rods on
each side, or a row of six pillars with the central two larger and
more decorated. Twenty-three, however, remain to be accounted
for, and the solution of the difficulty is observed at once in the distinction
between <em>odd and even</em> numbers. As was previously suggested
there are obvious difficulties in having posts in a balustrade at any
but equal distances, since the gaps left by unequal distances from
the centre would destroy their reason for being. This difficulty can
easily be overcome in wrought iron by extra central decoration, although
it is not always done by any means; but in stone balustrades,
unless there is carved open-work, or solid reliefs, there is no
other choice than repeated posts, either divided into sections or continuous,
and no variation is possible except to have an even or odd
number of them. We should then expect that there would be an odd
number in separate detached enclosures, bringing a post in the
centre to emphasize the balance, while in a continuous series each
group would have an even number, thus giving no centre to fixate
upon, but driving the attention on without repose at any one point
more than another. It might seem doubtful that any such refinement
should have been actually expressed in architecture, but
examination of these examples shows this treatment to be very
general. Of the twenty-three examples of separate enclosed details,
eleven have an odd number of posts. Of the ten that remain, <em>four</em>
are examples of windows along the side of a building, with separate
detachments of balustrade in front of each. By having an even number
of group-units the continuity of the row is maintained in spite
of a separation of the sections. <em>Two</em> of the ten are sections of balustrade
over the central doorway of a building. These balustrades
are divided into three sections, of which the centre is widest and
the ends only half as wide. Thus, although there are six posts in the
central section, the balustrade as a whole is distinctly divided into
a bilateral symmetrical arrangement. <em>Three</em> of the others have an
even number of pillars, but they support an odd number of arches;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
and the arch, not the pillar, is taken as the unit of the repeated
series. (Arches will be discussed later.) The <em>one</em> example unaccounted
for represents a number of possible cases, where for some
reason, following out a general scheme of building, or what not,
the odd number is not insisted upon for separate clusters. But the
fact that only one out of twenty-three is thus unexplained shows an
unmistakeable tendency in the other direction.</p>

<p>A distinction between odd and even numbers cannot be felt above
eight repetitions without actual counting, and often not even then.</p>

<p>The two final exceptions are of a gate and a decoration over a
door (Fontainebleau, Piacenza) where there are nine or more units
in the group. It is impossible to feel the system of this arrangement,
and the result is proportionately confusing. A reservation must be
made here concerning iron railings. There is no discrimination between
odd and even in the number of iron rods in a section of railing
and no tendency to symmetrical designs rather than rhythmic
before detached enclosures. This is because from the nature of
the case, there is no distinction possible between odd and even in
the number of slender iron rods necessary to enclose a space with
any security. There must of necessity be so many of them that the
difference cannot be perceived, and so slight is the importance of
each rod that the effect is more of a variegated surface than of actual
beats of a rhythm. As soon as iron is wrought into large enough
shapes, each repeated detail is of the same importance as in stone,
but the slender rods commonly used in iron railings, although their
repetition is rhythmic like all the others, give too slight a motor impulse
to carry the attention past the heavy limits of whatever they
enclose. They are found in front of many windows, but on account
of the lightness of their rhythm compared with the solidity of limiting
piers, no confusion results.</p>

<p>Having thus concluded that the odd numbers of units in groups
is more adapted for separate enclosures, is the opposite true? In
the continuous balustrade, previously discussed, are the units of groups
made up of an even number of elements? Of the fifty-seven examples
cited of continuous railings, thirty-one have an even number
of posts in their groups. These conform to the rule: but what will
explain the twenty-six remaining? It will be noticed that <em>six</em> of
these have too many in a group for the eye to perceive any difference
between odd and even, since they range from nine to thirteen.
When so many units are in a group, the effect is always of the run-on
type, whether the actual number turns out to be odd or even on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
subsequent count. <em>One</em> has a balustrade with only two sections on
a side, each side of the centre door. Seven are in each section, and
since the appearance of a symmetrical whole is the desired effect, an
odd number is more in keeping than an even; in fact, this example,
Monte Berico, might better come under the other head of separate
enclosures, although it partakes of the character of both. Another
balustrade with three in a section (Blois ChÃ¢teau) is so heavy and
massive in all its parts that fixity and solidity is more in keeping
with it than rhythm. <em>Eleven</em> of them, that is, the larger proportion
of all those with an odd number of pillars in a section, support
arches, and the arch is taken as the unit instead of the separate
pillar; and we find an even number of arch-units in each section,
which is what we should have expected. It is a noticeable fact,
which was previously suggested in connection with separate enclosures,
that when a row of pillars supports a plain lintel, the <em>pillar</em>
is taken as the unit of repetition. (When the row is on the front of
a building, temple, etc., the <em>opening</em> may be the unit, if the <em>purpose</em>
of the central door or the fact of <em>going through</em> is in the mind:
but when the series stands for itself, the <em>pillar</em> is the unit.) When
pillars support arches, the <em>arch</em> is the unit, unless it is very narrow
as in the Moorish style, when the pillar is often so high and the arch
so narrow in comparison that its value is weakened.</p>

<p>Of the thirty-one balustrades with an even number of parts in
a section, four sets of pillars bear arches, and make an odd number
of them. This would seem to make an exception to the rule
were they not so narrow in two cases that the pillar was still the
unit, and in the other two the motif of the arch was built around
the intervening piers, so that they did not seem divided into sections
at all, but continuous.</p>

<p>We have thus surveyed the whole field of repetitions of rhythmic
and symmetrical units, and their difference in treatment according
to the end they serve, and the results bear out our expectations.
The symmetrical unit, as exemplified chiefly by an odd number
of units in groups, is more used for detached enclosures; and the
rhythmic type, with even numbers, is used more especially for continuous
ones. In the former case the motor tendency is toward the
central balance, while in the latter it is driven on out of itself through
the series. When pillars support arches, the arch is the unit; when
they support lintels, the pillars themselves remain the unit. Any
number of units over eight loses its value of odd or even, since the
difference can no longer be perceived and becomes rhythmic whether
odd or even.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<p>It must not be supposed that these rules are inevitably carried
out or that the effect is necessarily poor if they are not. It shows
a general Ã¦sthetic demand, however, which in individual cases
may be modified by other demands, or altered in parts to make a
more unified whole. When, however, the series is taken for itself,
and judged entirely on its own merits, these conclusions will be
found generally valid.</p>

<p>We have still to consider whether series always end with a heavy
unit. All the series examined <em>do</em> end in this way; in fact we feel
the necessity of this so clearly that one illustration would be as
good as a hundred. But there is a difference in the use of the end
unit, which is noticeable in any two series of symmetrical and rhythmic
units. Of the sixteen examples of continuous series whose
units were distinctly symmetrical instead of rhythmic, eight of them,
although ending on supports, do not end on the principal unit of
the series. This can be best shown by one or two examples. The
Orvieto Cathedral has on the faÃ§ade a balustrade of rectangular
reliefs alternating with supports. The reliefs are undoubtedly the
more interesting and important element of the series, yet the series
ends with the less important element, the support or post, and we
feel that it must do so. The Palazzo Contarini has a balustrade
on its faÃ§ade in which carved wheel-like designs alternate with
supports which come at the ends. Why, in these cases, do we feel
it as inevitable that the heavier and more important unit should <em>not</em>
come at the end, as with rhythmic units we feel that they should?
The answer to this is partly structural and partly Ã¦sthetic. We must
feel, first of all, that the series is properly supported, that it will
not fall away at the ends or down in the middle, and for this reason
support of some kind must come at the end to hold it up and give
a feeling of solidity and stability. But why are not these supports
made the more interesting and important unit so that they might
still bear up the superstructure and end the series as well? Here
the Ã¦sthetic demand appears. As soon as the object is regarded as
an Ã¦sthetic unity and care put upon it to make it beautiful for its
own sake, it must not be thought of as the <em>end</em> of any series. It must
be cut off from the rest of the world by supports or framed in some
way, and while it still may have a place in a series, provided it is
sufficiently conventionalized and not too important in itself, it must
not be thought of as either ending or beginning, as depending on
a series to give it importance, or lending support to anything else.
It simply exists, cut off from the world, even though in the balustrade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
not an integral part of it, and one ought to be able to remove
it without affecting the stability of the structure.</p>

<p>The question whether series of symmetrical units have less heavy
ends to finish them than series of rhythmic units cannot be settled
by these methods of analysis. While it seems certain that the rhythmic
series drives the attention on by its greater motor activity,
and hence would need more of an end to stop it, so many other
factors enter in of more importance, such exact measurements would
be necessary (quite impossible with the photographs of the scale
here used), the refinement would be so great, since the stone of which
most of the examples are made, by its own weight supplies a check
to rhythmic activity, all these considerations make it impossible to
illustrate this conclusion and it must remain an experimental
result alone.</p>

<p>There remains one question: Is regular repetition of three units
ever found? They may be in combination of some kind so that they
fall into a rhythm of twos, but are they ever found repeated as three
separate and distinct units? The answer to this is without exception.
Of the five thousand photographs analyzed, not one instance
of this kind of series was found. In many cloisters the pillars are
of different design, and often one design is repeated through an
otherwise varying series, but their repetition is either without scheme
of any kind, or in some combination that falls into a rhythm of twos.
No three-rhythm has been used in art, any more than it has been
found possible in experiments.</p>


<p class="p6">A<span class="smcapa">RCHES</span></p>

<p>It has been noticed in the preceding discussion that when a series
of pillars supports arches, the arch, not the pillar, is taken as the
unit. If this is so, it would seem that the arch by binding two pillars
together with a curve awakens a more vigorous response than the
vertical line of the pillars, and this greater expenditure of activity
makes it to be taken as the element of repetition. It suggested that
the arch (like the rhythmic unit) tends to drive attention on out of
one unit to the next in the series. The outward thrust of the arch
arouses an outward-tending activity, and for this reason a row of
<em>arches</em> would need, to give a finished, stable effect, a wider and heavier
embankment at the end than a series of lintels. The experiments
on this point were inconclusive owing to the difficulty of obtaining
a series of arches and of lintels which should be comparable in size.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
For this reason the validity of this suggestion must depend upon
the actual treatment of arches in architecture. It would seem that
the arch would, like the rhythmic unit, be more appropriate for continuous
series than for detached short rows; or if the series were
short, the ends should be treated in some way, by reduction in
size, change in width of pillar, pier, or decoration, so that the
outward-activity might be counteracted by some inward thrust or
some accentuation of the centre. Thus the unity or balance of the
series as a whole would prevent the arches from seeming to "run
away" which they might appear to do without such treatment. We
shall, then, look through photographs of buildings where arches are
used, to find if their treatment carries out the supposition.</p>

<p>It may be seen at once that such a treatment of arches differs
from the arrangement necessary to make plain lintels effective. The
pillars on the front of Greek temples were indeed slightly farther
apart at the middle entrance, and the centre was moreover further
accented by the point of the pediment. But on the sides the rows
of from thirteen to sixteen columns had equal interspace and no
noticeably heavier columns or embankment of any kind at the ends,
for none was necessary. The series appeared ended whenever it
stopped, and did not carry the attention over, nor demand some
finish to "hold it down," as does the arch. The pillars, to be sure,
completely surrounded the temple, and so were, in name, continuous.
But on a building with square corners, the other sides do not
carry the series on to the eye (with variations in foreshortening of
the ends) as in a circular structure, and the effect of continuity is
not immediate.</p>

<p>Many examples might be given of buildings with pillars and
lintels on the faÃ§ade, which have no visible modifications of central
or end columns to give balance or symmetry to the whole, and yet
which are perfectly satisfactory as repeated series and do not demand
either such treatment or further continuation, but are complete and
finished: London, Trafalgar Square; Rome, Pantheon; Vienna,
St. Karl, Barrome Kirche; Berlin, Schillerplatz, etc. These have
the centre accented by the superstructure, but there is no discernible
modification of the series itself.</p>

<p>Examples might be multiplied, but there are sufficient to illustrate
the essential stability of repeated vertical units and to contract them
with the outward-tending, run-on effect of arches which need various
kinds of treatments to finish a series.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
kinds of treatments to finish a series.</p>

<p>Of one hundred and sixty-five examples of such series examined,
only seven do not conform to the principles we have considered,
and these are proportionately unsatisfactory. Forty-five illustrate
buildings where the arches go completely around the outside of a
structure, so that the series instead of requiring an end simply runs
into itself again. It will be noticed further, that unlike series of columns
around rectangular Greek temples, these are around circular structures
where the series does not change its direction suddenly but by
degrees. With the exception of courts and cloisters where the observer
stands within and sees the whole series, these are all around
domes, baptisteries, etc., where the end arches in the field at any one
point of view are seen in perspective gradually fading off and yet
leading attention on around the building. There may indeed be arches
which go across square-cornered buildings or even around them,
but in these cases some other device is necessary to make each side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
a finished series in itself. The mere fact of its continuance around
a corner where it cannot be seen from the same point of view is not
enough. (These various arrangements of arches on a flat faÃ§ade
will be taken up later.) Rows of arches are often used around towers
square as well as round, but towers from their very shape and size
allow the observer to see different sides from nearly the same point
of view, so the series is not broken up into sections on different sides
of the tower as it is in a larger building. Twenty more examples
are of arches in interiors and are all of arches down a nave, with
either a regular arch or an arch motif carried across the apse. It
might be supposed that an arrangement of arches in an interior
would be more difficult than on an exterior surface, since the genius
of an arch is its outward thrust and its tendency to run on. Without
careful treatment it would spoil the interior by trying to overstep
its bounds; by making certain walls look wider than others;
the arched sections utterly discrete in general character from the
plain or otherwise decorated section. In point of fact, the use of
the arch-series in interiors is quite conventionalized, and all the illustrations
are of loggias, or of churches where the arch goes down the
nave and in a more or less modified form across the apse. In the
Sistine Chapel the arched windows go down the side walls and across
the end in a vaulted double-arch. In some cases a series of Roman
arches down the nave has a more or less pointed arch across the
apse, but in every case the continuity has been kept in some way so
that the series is unbroken. Moreover the columns in the cathedral
naves are often so high and the arches so proportionally narrow
that the pillar instead of the arch is taken as the unit. This is somewhat
true in St. Mark, Venice, also in St. Sophia, Constantinople,
where the large arches are divided into sections of seven smaller
ones, each one of which is so narrow that the pillar is felt as the
repeated unit instead of the arch; or if the arch be taken, the narrow
span prevents it from too great outward thrust.</p>

<p>Thirty of the arch-series are on faÃ§ades of buildings or in structures
by themselves, as gates and triumphal arches, where the central
arch is larger than the other, thereby emphasizing the middle
point and drawing attention to it away from the ends. This centralizing
a series or balancing it as a whole may be accomplished
in various ways. Two examples make the central arch larger instead
of smaller. Six make the end arches smaller while four make them
larger. It will be readily seen that just which one of these variations is
chosen for the series depends on the function of the series. The central<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
arch is wider, with only one exception, when the series is of arched
doors and the central door is the main entrance; while the end
arches are more apt to be varied when the series is purely decorative
and serves no function. The central balance may be further
gained by differences of level. In the decorations of many faÃ§ades,
especially the early Romanesque, rows of arches go obliquely into
the point of the roof and by this strong pointing toward the centre
create an inward tendency. Six of the illustrations have the central
arch accented by decoration; seven have heavier piers around the
central and end arches; six have the end arches brought out into
a nearer plane which effectually finishes the series. All these examples
illustrate the necessary disposition of arches on a flat wall or
faÃ§ade where the series in the field of vision must end suddenly,
that is, cannot gradually fade away around a corner. The variety
and yet invariability of these devices shows the need felt for some
finish at the end, some balance of the whole with the central accent,
which need, apparently, is not felt for pillars and lintels.</p>

<p>When the arch-series is on a circular structure, such as apses,
porches, and the like, even when it does not entirely surround it, as
an arena or spire, the regular diminishing of the series on either side,
owing to the curve, supplies the finish necessary, and the size and
arrangement of the arches need not vary otherwise. Twelve of the
examples illustrate such a use of the arch, and although in some cases,
Morano Cathedral, Nomantala Church, the arches are continued
into the transepts gradually tapering in size, or are modified in size
growing narrower from the centre, as in the Bergamo Church, such
a treatment is not necessary for finished effect. The difference in
proportion resulting from a curved series, or even on arches carried
around a square corner (as in porches on Goslar and Braunschweig
RathÃ¤user), where the series is open enough to clearly see its continuity
as it runs into the main building, will suffice to make a series
finished without modifications of the arch-units.</p>

<p>There are many instances of long rows of very narrow arches on
cathedral faÃ§ades which are too narrow to give outward tendency,
or else they have statues within them which really take the attention
and form a series of vertical units in place of the arches. There
is also the common device of interlacing arches, where a supporting
pillar of another arch stands in the centre of every arch, thereby
always driving the attention backward and restraining it. Perhaps
the natural outward tendency of the arch-series and the necessity
for its limitation can be seen by violations of the principle. Seven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
of the examples do not conform to any application of this rule and
the results are not satisfactory so far as the mere series itself is concerned.
Over the right and left doors of the Piacenza Cathedral
are sections of nine arches which end abruptly and do not even meet
each other. The Fredericksborg Schloss at Copenhagen has a row
of fifteen arches enclosing a court. These run into wings on each
side, to be sure, but all seen at once as they are and without central
or end modification they are too sharply cut off and inclined to overstep
their limits. The Loggia dei Lanzi at Florence, with its three
wide arches and narrow pillars, the William Tell Chapel in Switzerland,
with only two arches, illustrate forcibly the tendency of an
arch to move outward, to appear too wide for the superstructure
and too "active" unless bound down in some way. Four arches
on the right and left of the faÃ§ade of Marmonte Church, but not
across the centre, have the same unfinished effect. The roman arch
on one side of the St. Lo Cathedral faÃ§ade with two gothic arches
on the other defy every principle of repetition and symmetry as well.</p>

<p>From this survey of one hundred and sixty-five of arch-series we
find through a variety of means a uniformity of purpose in their
treatment; that all point to a common demand, however differently
expressed, according to the function of the series. The series must
be prevented from "running away." It must either run completely
around a structure into itself, or be balanced as a whole so that the
attention which naturally runs off the ends is driven towards the
centre. This may be accomplished by enlarging, decreasing, decorating,
or pointing toward centre of the arch by means of the obliquity
of both halves of the series. It may also be brought by enlarging,
decreasing, changing the plane of the end arches or altering the
size of the limiting piers. The essential value of the arch may be
altered by narrowing it, by filling it with something more important
than itself, thereby making it only an attendant series upon its content,
by interlacing it, or by any device that transforms or revises its
outward tendency.</p>

<p>The question discussed in the experiments, as to whether narrower
interspacing was required between units decorated toward
the centre, and units blank, or covered entirely with non-centrally
accented decoration, could not be taken up in the latter analysis.
To settle such a point, illustrations would have to be found of blank
and decorated units of the same shape and size, in the same structure,
and their relative interspacing compared. But no such examples
were found, where the spacing was not regulated by some obvious
structural reason other than pure pleasure in the repetition. This
must stand, therefore, solely as an experimental result.</p>

<p>The use made of difference in plane or end, to facilitate two series
being taken along together, whereas they would be fatiguing if the
same in those respects, has been touched upon in the discussion of
statues and bas-reliefs, and other series of more complicated units.
Where the unit and alternate are both rich and significant, and would
tire the observer by following each other at the distances they are
obliged to be in a series, a slight difference in plane relieves the situation,
and is used largely in monuments, fountains, pulpits, and such
structures.</p>

<p>Many other questions have come up in the investigation which
might be discussed in the same manner as the preceding, but can
only be hinted at in conclusion:</p>

<p>Just what factors make an element and its alternate congruous?
What is the exact relation of lines, which makes the scroll decoration
in a balustrade alternate satisfactorily with an upright support,
while the alternation of the arches in the Colosseum with the
Greek pillars between them is incongruous?</p>

<p>In what does the pleasure in repeated series differ, when the observer
is not certain just what is the repeated element? May there
be a bare rhythmic pleasure, when the series is too far away to distinguish
what the elements are, or when they run together, so that
no definite demarcation is felt between them? Do such series excite
a pleasure of repetition without content as to elements, and does
it differ from mere variation and contrast?</p>

<p>The series of unsymmetrical units was found in the experiments
to have a peculiarly unstable run-on effect similar to that of rhythmic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
units and of arches. Are they used in the same kind of cases as the
others were, when a particularly active effect is desired?</p>

<p>Must a space be wholly enclosed, to be taken as a unit?</p>

<p>In a series of projections along a wall, the <em>projections</em> are taken
as the unit, even when they almost meet at the top of the alternate
space. When they actually do meet at the top, the enclosed space
becomes the unit instead.</p>

<p>These questions and others similar might be experimented upon,
and examples of their treatment analyzed, as in the previous questions
discussed.</p>

<h2>THE FEELING-VALUE OF UNMUSICAL TONE-INTERVALS</h2>

<p class="p1b">BY L. E. EMERSON</p>


<p>Modern theories of melody start always with the presupposition
that the scale must be composed of tones having the simple
mathematical relation to one another of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (and by Meyer
7) and their multiples in order to give pleasant combinations of successive
tones. But the question arises whether other tone-combinations
which given together appear disharmonious may not, by their
mere acoustical difference, similarity, and contrast, awake definite
feelings of pleasure. And if such feeling-tones exist independently
from harmony it is evident that they would enter into every melody
in addition to the strictly musical feelings of harmony and that they
deserve consideration as a factor of music. It would not even appear
impossible that if every successive tone-distance has its particular
natural feeling-character, the distances of successive harmonious
tones might be only through secondary factors as habit and training
preÃ«minent among the various possibilities of combinations. A tone-consciousness,
which under the guidance of experiences of harmony
has been trained in our musical tone-relations, must give instinctive
preference to such successions as our melodies offer. But if we artificially
inhibit the conscious relation to our musical system by introducing
a continuous tone-series, or at least one of steps much smaller
than musical intervals, do we destroy the possibility of pleasure,
and if not, do we find the pleasure in the musical interval stronger
than that in other instances? That even the musical subject introduced
into the realm of smallest tone-steps can easily forget and
inhibit his normal standards is well known; the whole acoustical
perspective seems changed by the new intervals, and the subject
begins at once to build up a new temporary system of relations.
The experiments in Wundt's laboratory have shown that in such
cases the theoretical judgment of distances is indeed quite different
from the standardized one; the octave may appear equal to the higher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
fifth. I wanted to study in a similar way the feeling-value in such
a state of musical disorientation, when all imaginative representations
of our musical intervals are inhibited.</p>

<p>The instrument I used was an Appun Tonmesser giving reed-tones
from 128 to 512 vibrations in intervals of 4 vibrations between
adjacent tones. The intervals with which I experimented varied
from 4 to 88 vibrations in steps of 4. The observers were all experimental
psychologists, and varied in musical discrimination from a
very low to a very high degree of natural ability and skill.</p>

<p>The observer reported his pleasure in the progression given, in
the traditional grades of 1 to 7, where 1 represents the greatest
degree of pleasure, 2 means very pleasant, 3 pleasant, 4 indifferent,
5 unpleasant, 6 very unpleasant, and 7 most unpleasant of all.</p>

<p>The immediate problem was: What is the relation between the
width of interval used and the pleasure got by hearing the motive
<em>a-b-a</em> and <em>b-a-b</em>, where <em>a</em> is always the lower tone. The method of
procedure was to take a fixed tone (460 vibrations in the first case)
and get a series of observations on successive progressions <em>b-a-b</em>
where <em>a</em> differed from <em>b</em> by 4, 8, 12 ... 56 vibrations. The greatest
difference thus is approximately a musical whole tone. Then a series
of observations was taken on <em>a-b-a</em> where <em>a</em> similarly differed from <em>b</em>
by 4, 8, 12 ... 52 vibrations. The progressions were given in irregular
order, that there might be no chance of the observer getting
into a fixed habit of replying. The intimate relation between the
pleasure in successive musical tones and the pleasure in musical
harmonies suggested naturally the question whether the feeling-value
of these unmusical progressions was not somehow dependent upon
the affective character of the simultaneous presentation of the same
tones. Therefore after a progression had been given once and judgment
recorded, the two tones used were given as a "harmony," that
is simultaneously, and a judgment taken as to its agreeableness. This
was immediately followed by the same progression, thus giving opportunity
to observe the relation between the feeling-tone of the interval
as it appeared in successive and in simultaneous presentation.</p>

<p>The results of this part of the investigation are graphically represented
in the following plates. Tables I and II indicate the feeling-value
of <em>a-b-a</em> where <em>a</em>, the lower tone, is 460 vibrations, and <em>b</em> is
from 4 to 56 vibrations in addition, and the feeling-value of <em>b-a-b</em>
where <em>b</em>, the higher tone, is 460 vibrations and <em>a</em> is from 4 to 56 vibrations
less.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img  src="images/i_271.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="caption">P<span class="smcapa">LATE</span> VI.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The base-lines from which the vertical lines to the curves are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
drawn represent the feeling-tone 4, the indifference-point. Above
comes 3, 2, 1 and below 5, 6, 7; each square represents a unit. The
horizontal abscissÃ¦ represent the width of the interval; the arrows
indicate the musical intervals. The observers are given by initials.
The first evident fact for both average curves of Plate V is that
the maximum pleasure does not coincide with a musical interval,
but comes with an interval four or eight vibrations less than either
the half or the full tone of the musical scale. While in both cases
the first elevation of the curve comes before the semi-tone, <em>b-a-b</em>
shows a decrease of pleasure as the whole step is approached while
<em>a-b-a</em> rises again. The order <em>a-b-a</em> is liked better than <em>b-a-b</em>.</p>

<p>Plate VI gives the "harmony" curve for the same tone-combinations,
and it is clear at the first glance that the curves for the
simultaneous tones do not correspond to those for the successive
ones; in many respects they are directly the opposite. The hypothesis
that the pleasure in such an amusical "melody" results from
the resolution of the corresponding "harmony" is thus untenable;
both are highly independent of each other. Yet, here too we notice
the insignificance of the musical interval, while the strong pleasure
in the tones different by 4 vibrations only refers probably to the
complete fusion of the tones; there arises a direct enjoyment from
the four waves of sound in every second, given by the beats. The
pleasure-curve of these simultaneous tones indicates of course that
the inhibition of the musical dispositions and expressions holds over
from the successive to the simultaneous series. The pleasure is
thus clearly different from that in real harmony.</p>

<p>Plate VII finally gives the "melody" curve for <em>aba</em> and <em>bab</em> with
changes from four to four vibrations when the interval started with
is larger than a full musical step. In <em>aba</em> the <em>a</em> is 384 vibrations and <em>b</em>
varies from 436 to 516, the variations lying thus between the musical
Second and the musical Fourth. It is evident that here again no
feeling-preference is given to the musical intervals.</p>

<p>The question arises whether such small tone-intervals of amusical
character allow the construction of more complex combinations of
Ã¦sthetic value. Can we have amusical micromelodies with their own
completeness and feeling of end? The following experiments represent
a first step into this field. We used three tones only, <em>a, b, c</em> in 26
different combinations, and each of the 26 variations with intervals
of 4, 8 and 12 vibrations between <em>a-b</em> and <em>b-c</em>. Each of the resulting
78 "melodies" was given repeatedly to six subjects in a time-order
which allowed one second for each tone. The subject had to judge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
on the pleasantness of the whole progression and had further to
judge whether it produced a feeling of end or not.</p>

<p>The combinations followed in the experiments in this order: <em>abc</em>,
<em>cbabc</em>, <em>abcb</em>, <em>cba</em>, <em>abcba</em>, <em>cbab</em>, <em>bcba</em>, <em>cbabcb</em>, <em>ababc</em>, <em>babc</em>, <em>abcbab</em>, <em>babcba</em>,

<em>bca</em>, <em>cabcb</em>, <em>bac</em>. The lowest tone was varied between 200 and 444
vibrations; <em>b</em> and <em>c</em> were thus always still less distant than the next
musical tone. The chief results may be shortly characterized as
follows. There are hardly any judgments of indifference, the combinations
are always decidedly pleasing or unpleasing. Of course
a certain training in the apperception of such small-interval melodies
preceded the real experiments and produced an attitude of adjustment
to amusical relation. If we are in the midst of musical tone-relations
and go over directly to such miniature intervals, we are seeking for
the fulfilment of the habitual expectation and feel dissatisfied, or in
the best case the procession is an indifferent chance combination.
But as soon as a certain training with small intervals has inhibited
the strictly musical expectations, a new setting of judgments with
new standards comes in and a new source of pleasantness is opened.
Of course even then no extreme feelings are to be expected; while
the indifference-judgment 4 is lacking, the strong pleasure and displeasure,
the judgments 1 and 7 are completely lacking too; three
fourths of the judgments are 3 and 5. The pleasantness is decidedly
more frequent than the unpleasantness, and this relation increases
with the interval. The differences of four vibrations were especially
with the higher tones hardly distinct for some of the subjects. Among
288 judgments in each group there were 150 pleasant and 138 unpleasant
when the distances between <em>a-b</em> and <em>b-c</em> were four vibrations,
208 pleasant and 80 unpleasant when the distances were 8
vibrations, and 226 pleasant and 64 unpleasant when the distances
were 12 vibrations.</p>

<p>The order of pleasantness expressed by the fraction of judgments of
pleasantness and unpleasantness is the following: the largest number
of pleasant feelings belonged to the figures <em>cbab</em> and <em>bac</em>, immediately
followed by <em>abcb</em>; the further order downwards in affective
value was: <em>cab</em>, <em>cbac</em>, <em>babc</em>, <em>abca</em>, <em>cbcba</em>, <em>ababc</em>, <em>abc</em>, <em>cabc</em>, <em>acba</em>, <em>cbabcb</em>,
<em>bcba</em>, <em>acb</em>, <em>abcba</em>, <em>cba</em>, <em>cbabc</em>, <em>abcab</em>, <em>babcba</em>, <em>cbacb</em>, <em>acbab</em>, <em>bcbabc</em>,
<em>abcbab</em>, and <em>cabcb</em> as least pleasant.</p>

<p>As to the feeling of end or Ã¦sthetic completeness the results are
similar and yet independent. In a few cases the answer was "doubtful,"
but in the overwhelming majority a definite reply was given;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
and while the judgment of completeness was by far more frequent in
the pleasant combinations than in the unpleasant ones, yet often
the unpleasant processions appeared as complete and the pleasant
ones as incomplete. Here again the feeling of completeness grows
with the interval, being smallest for the figures with distances of four
vibrations. But most characteristic seems the fact that the feeling of
end is in no way as in music dependent upon the return to the starting-point.
The combinations which involved such return to the
"tonica" show in no way a preponderance of judgments of completeness.
If we order the results according to the number of this Ã¦sthetic
factor the figures <em>acba</em>, <em>cbac</em>, and <em>cabc</em> stand very low, giving in the
majority of cases the suggestion of not-completeness in spite of their
return to the beginning, while the figures of the type <em>abcb</em>, <em>cbab</em>, or
<em>cba</em>, or even the complex <em>babcba</em>, suggest in a majority of judgments
the feeling of an end. The feeling of an end comes, according to the
subjective reports of the observers, with an "internal unity of meaning"
of the phrase given. This unity of meaning is here evidently
quite independent from any simple mathematical relation.</p>

<p>The music-like quality of the figures was emphasized frequently
in the subjective records. "I just enjoyed the progressions as music."
"The elements are the same as in music." A melody of 384, 392,
400 was called a "very mournful strain"; 444, 452, 460 "Wagnerian
motive; Tristan and Isolde"; and the same tones in another order
"Very pleasant; expressed a pathetic resignation," or "Sounds like
a little piece of music"; and so in most varied forms.</p>

<p>The basis of these experiments is of course by far too slender to
build on them a theory, yet our results suggest at least a greater interest
in the Ã¦sthetics of those tone-combinations which are excluded from
our regular music. This interest is reÃ«nforced by the self-observations
of all participants. They felt strongly that after all our musical
pleasure in melody does not belong intrinsically to the tone-perception,
but is learned and acquired like the grammar of our mother
tongue. Such grammar too controls completely our internal demands
for expression, and yet the learning of a different language can bring
a new adjustment and a new set of psychophysical dispositions for
linguistic demands. That whole apparently natural demand for the
tone-combinations which give fusion and consonance can be inhibited
during the listening to amusical combinations as soon as a
short training in miniature intervals changes the acoustical perspective.</p>

<p>The development of instrumental music demanded evidently the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
selection of distinctly separated tones and of intervals which give
harmonious combinations. The external conditions of resonant
chambers may have reÃ«nforced this selective process of historical
music. It is certainly different with oriental nations, which produce
music not in resounding chambers but in the free air and who are
singers and not players, using instruments mostly for producing a
mere body of tone as a background against which the melodies move;
their intervals appear to our musical ear at first bizarre, and yet there
too we are readjusted to the new dispositions for satisfaction with
unsuspected quickness. We have no right to identify Ã¦sthetic pleasure
in successive tones with the pleasure in our conventional music
with the simple mathematical relations which alone give the pleasure
of fusion; but being accustomed to this system of harmonies and
being trained to expect it also in the resolved form of the melody, we
need indeed an inhibition of habits and a certain new training till
the more modest pleasure in amusical tone progressions comes to its
natural right.</p>

<p class="p1b">BY FRANCES H. ROUSMANIERE</p>


<p>The results of the experiments on the feeling of certainty which
I have conducted fall into two divisions&mdash;those on the nature of the
feeling itself, and those on the effect of voluntarily attending to certain
aspects of a total experience upon certainty in the judgments as to the
constitution of that experience. The problems of the first division are:
Are there different kinds of certainty? In any one kind of certainty
are there degrees, and if so, are these of a limited or an unlimited number?
Can certainty be analyzed into elements? The problems of the
second division are: Can it be said that in the report of any experience
the judgments made with the highest degree of certainty will be
confined to an attended-to group, and if not, will there be more there
than elsewhere? In such a report will the direction of voluntary
attention toward certain aspects materially alter the distribution of
the judgments of the highest order of certainty over the various aspects
of any given field?</p>

<p>These two divisions are so distinct in problem and result as to make
it seem best to describe them as independent experiments. As some
interesting results on the relation of error to the different grades of certainty
and to the effect of attention developed in connection with this
second division of the experiment, those results are given also.</p>

<p>In general the same subjects took part throughout the experiments.
One, an instructor in Harvard University, whom I shall call K, was
not subject for the second division of the experiment. Two others, E
and H, both graduate students in Harvard University, could not serve
as subjects in an important part of the first division. Of those remaining,
B was a student in Radcliffe College, F an instructor in Harvard
University, and A, C, and D graduate students in Harvard University.
These last five were my subjects for all parts of the experiment.</p>

<p>The general method here was, of course, the method of introspection.
Situations were created about which the subject might be expected to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
make judgments with different sorts or different degrees of certainty, if
such should be possible. He was then questioned as to his experience.
The method has the fault of all introspective methods, viz., its results
can in no case be verified. The results here are none the less
suggestive, and, for the second problem, at any rate, definite enough
to be convincing.</p>

<p>Most of the experiments were conducted in connection with visual
fields. In working at the first problem which we have now to consider,
however, the certainty connected with the dermal sensations and that
connected with the simple reasoning process of addition were also examined.
The apparatus used consisted of three sets of cards. On one
set were pasted geometrical shapes cut from colored paper, and black
and white letters or figures. Each of these cards was shown to a subject
for a second and a half, or two seconds. After the exposure he told
what he judged to be on the card, giving all that he could about the
nature of his feeling of confidence (or certainty) for each judgment. On
the second set of cards square pieces of tin, smooth rubber, rough rubber,
cotton, felt, undressed kid, leather, eiderdown, flannel, coarse
and fine sandpaper, and pricked paper were stuck, six on each card.
The experimenter passed these cards so that these bits of material
rubbed against the forefinger of the subject, while a curtain kept the
card and the hand hidden from the subject's sight. Here, again, the
subject judged of what had been on the card, just as he had done after
seeing each of the first set of cards. Small sample cards, each having
pasted upon it a piece of one of the substances used, were also behind
the curtain, and the subject was allowed to feel of these as much as
he wished while giving his report. Such sample cards were required
because of the underdevelopment of the association of names of any
kind with the dermal sensations. A single card with three groups of
figures for addition upon it made up the third part of the apparatus.
Here the subject was asked first to add the columns rapidly and to
introspect as to his certainty of the correctness of the different results;
then to go over the addition again, and yet a third time, and to compare
his feelings of certainty in the different cases. The introspection
was developed partly through the help of questions put by the experimenter,
but in asking these questions great care was taken to prevent
their influencing the judgment of the subject. Some observations made
by the subjects during the second division of the experiment (also
conducted in connection with visual fields) are, also, introduced here.
Apart from this, the experiments on the feeling of certainty connected
with this sense of sight were greater in number than the other experiments;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
and it is those that have given us most of the data for answering
the second and third problems.</p>

<p>The subjects did not agree in their answers to the first problem.
Some found not only that the certainty connected with their belief in
the results of their addition seemed to be of a distinct type from that
connected immediately with the sense of sight, but also that there were
different sorts of certainty connected immediately with the sense of
sight itself. Others found but one kind of a feeling of certainty. All
agreed, however, that so far as the kind or kinds of certainty associated
with them was concerned there was no difference between the sense of
sight and the dermal senses, so that it would seem to be true that
any distinctions which are to be found within the feeling of certainty
will not be distinctions springing from the difference in the sense-organs.
Within the sense of sight, however, subjects B, E, and F divided
their feelings of certainty into two classes,&mdash;an absolute feeling of certainty
which they felt could not be shaken, and a feeling of confidence
which they would act upon but which they felt might be shaken by
questioning, and which seemed different by more than degree from the
feeling of certainty proper. Subjects A, C, K and H found no such
marked distinction between their feeling of greatest certainty and all
lesser feelings of conviction. Subject D at one time felt that the distinction
into two such distinct classes, the definitely certain and the
more wavering, fitted his experience, and at another time said that it
seemed to him that each degree of conviction stood for an unique feeling
of certainty and that any two of them were as different from each
other as any other two. A second division of the feelings of certainty
into two classes is to be found with subjects A, F and H. This developed
in connection with the visual experiments again. The distinction here
may be called one into psychological and logical certainty. The latter
rests on reasoning either from the probable character of the field, or
from a feeling as to its general character, to the nature of some detail.
We shall notice the characteristics of these two classes later. One subject,
A, further distinguished as different the feelings of certainty connected
with the two methods of logical certainty just given. The others
made no such distinctions. In the experiment with the columns for
addition only six subjects, A, B, C, D, F, and K took part. Of these
the two who had made the distinction into psychological and logical
certainty with the visual experiments (subjects A and F) again made
the same distinction. Subject F, however, who had had occasion to do
a good deal of important work with statistics, found practically no
element of logical certainty in connection with his addition, though it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
seemed to him that what confidence he felt in his result should be
distinguished from the psychological certainty he had had as to the
character of the visual fields. Subject B felt no certainty in her results
except as she could so hold the process together as to have what
seemed to her a simultaneous experience. When she had to judge of
the results of a set of successive experiences that could not be so unified,
she characterized her state of consciousness not as holding a feeling of
certainty or of uncertainty, but as simply lacking any feeling of certainty.
The other three subjects found no difference between the feelings
of certainty and uncertainty associated with visual experiences
and those associated with the process of addition. As a whole, it seems
then that we must answer our first problem by saying that the case
seems to be different with different individuals. With some the highest
grade of certainty associated with a sense-experience is sharply distinct
from the other grades, and with some again there appear at least
the two general classes of psychological and logical certainty. On the
other hand, there seem to be people for whom the feeling of certainty
has no such sharp distinctions of kind within it.</p>

<p>The results as to the second problem may be more briefly and more
distinctly given. No subject found any evidence that the number of
the grades of certainty which he could distinguish would be limited by
anything except his keenness in introspection, although in the simple
tests given for the experiment, four was the greatest number of grades
distinguished at any one time. Two of the subjects (B and F), who set
the highest grade of certainty apart from the judgments made with
lesser confidence, said that there might be degrees within that higher
grade as well as among the "uncertainties." There was no evidence
that logical certainty differed from psychological in respect of the
grades to be found within it, and some evidence that they were alike
in that respect, although logical certainty was less carefully examined.
It would seem, then, that our second problem is to be answered thus:
There are degrees present in some if not in all kinds of certainty, and
there is no evidence that the number of these degrees is limited.</p>

<p>It was not generally found possible to analyze the feeling of certainty
into a sum of elements, although certain characteristics seemed to be
persistent in it. Here again there is marked individual variation. The
general test used for the difference in degrees of confidence was the
question "On which judgment would you risk more?" This satisfied
every one as a true criterion for such distinctions, but subjects H and
C said that for them the feeling of certainty had a much more distinct
relation with the past than with the future. Perhaps for that reason,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
subject H proposed the test "Which judgment could I be converted
from most easily and simply?" The distinctness of an image had something
to do with the feeling of certainty for subject C. Beyond this, he
could not characterize his feeling. Neither was he sure that the degree
of certainty varied exactly with the degree of distinctness. Subject D
found that all objects about which he made judgments of which he
was certain were present to his mind in the form of distinct images;
but did not feel that that covered all that was to be said of the feeling
of certainty. The number of images present, as visual and auditory,
seemed to increase the degree of certainty for him. Subject F could
give no characterization of his feeling of psychological certainty. His
feeling of logical certainty seemed to spring largely from a feeling of
consistency between the present experience and his past experiences.
With subjects A, B, and K the vividness of an image was a strong determining
factor in the degree of certainty felt in any judgment, but again
was not the whole story. Something they could not characterize was
also present for A and B, and, as well, a feeling of more or less perfect
congruence between an image and the general character of a field.
(This introspection developed in connection with the visual experiments.)
Among these eight subjects we have but one (K) who is satisfied
with reducing certainty to a set of elements.</p>

<p>To my mind the most valuable thing to be gained from this division
of the experiment is the suggestion that there are definite types of certainty,
and that people may be classified by these. There are obviously
marked individual variations as to the characteristics of this feeling.
I should expect from my work this year that two pretty distinct types
could be discovered. For one of these, certainty in a judgment as to an
experience would rest very largely upon the vividness of an image; for
the other, upon the congruence of an image with other previously accepted
images, that is, the absence of conflicting images when the experience
judged about is imagined part of a wide setting of past experiences.
I should not expect either element of certainty to appear absolutely,
without the other form. For many people one element would
predominate in certain fields, as in judgments regarding sense-experiences,
the other in the more logical fields. For some, again, perhaps,
the two would be nearly coÃ¶rdinate in every experience of certainty.
But for some subjects, as, I think, for subject K here, the vividness of
the image would always be the determining factor, while for others, as
for subject H, congruence with wider experience would be much more
important. This classification of subjects according to their types of
certainty might develop into a much more complicated affair. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
experiments described here have gone no farther than to suggest lines
along which it may perhaps run. There may be other elements equally
important with these two. A set of experiments consisting of attempts
to raise uncertainty to certainty would bring out the essentials of certainty
from a new point of view, and would, perhaps, test this theory
that individuals may be classified according to the types of their certainty,
in the most satisfactory manner.</p>

<p>As has been said, judgments as to the elements of visual fields were
tested for this part of the experiment. The apparatus used was the
following: The subject was seated before a low table which was shut
from his view by curtains and boards. He looked down upon the table
through an opening into which a camera-shutter had been fitted. This
shutter was set for a two seconds' exposure and opened by means of
a bulb which the subject held in his hand. Just before each exposure,
the experimenter placed a card on the table below the camera-shutter.
The set of twenty cards so used were alike in that the background
for all was gray and the objects pasted upon the cards black letters
and numerals and simple geometrical figures of chosen shapes and
colors. No color was repeated on any one card. The cards were
different in the choice and arrangement and in the number of objects
used. The number of letters and numerals on any one card varied
from two to five, the total number of objects from eight to twelve.
A white card on which were pasted dark gray samples of each of the
eleven shapes used, together with a card of the background of those
shown in the experiment on which were pasted torn scraps of the
eleven colored papers used, was always in sight at the subject's side.
A camera-shutter, experiment cards and sample cards thus made up
the apparatus.</p>

<p>The presence of the sample cards needs explanation. They stood
for the attempt to place the colors and shapes on the same footing as
the letters and numerals. Their presence, in the first place, and, as
well, the limitation of the number of letters and numerals used, did
away somewhat with the advantage that letters and numerals naturally
have for ease of naming. In the second place, the use of a new color
for the sample shapes and the absence of definite shape in the sample<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
colors helped to keep the colors and shapes more distinct. With the
help of these cards it seemed that we could properly hold we had a
a visual field of three very nearly coÃ¶rdinate sets of elements.</p>

<p>The experiment as a whole, as conducted, had four phases which,
except for one particular, were exactly alike. The subject's attention
was directed toward a certain aspect of the field by (1) asking him
before each exposure (or less often if that appeared unnecessary) to
attend to that aspect, as, for instance, to the colors present, and (2)
taking care that any questions asked should tend to strengthen rather
than counteract the effect of that voluntary attention. At a given
signal the subject pressed the bulb which opened the shutter. On the
closing of the shutter he reported what he had seen. This report the
experimenter recorded almost in the subject's own words, and later
tabulated in the manner described presently. So far as giving the
objects present was concerned, the report was given almost invariably
without any suggestion by the experimenter as to the possibilities of the
field. To help the subject distinguish the amount of confidence which
he had in the judgments that such or such objects were present, however,
the experimenter frequently asked such questions as, "Would
you risk more on the fact that there was a square in the field than on the
fact there was something blue there?" In giving his report the subject
pointed to the sample cards or spoke, as he might wish. He was also
allowed to be as leisurely or as rapid in giving it as he chose. A half-minute
interval elapsed between the end of each report and the signal
that the shutter be opened again. No persistent effort to distract the
subject's attention was made then, though conversation on other
topics was frequently carried on. The point in which the phases of the
experiment differed was in the aspect of the field to which attention
was called. In the first, this was the shapes, in the second, the colors,
in the third, the letters and numerals, and in the fourth, the number of
objects in the field. Fixing the attention upon the number of objects
in the field served to distribute it equally over all the groups represented
there. The general method of calling attention to the different
aspects and of learning the effect of such attention was, as has just
been said, the same for all phases.</p>

<p>As a preliminary to making up the tables here given, from which we
are to answer our problems, the experimenter first tabulated the reports
of the subjects in such a way as to show how many judgments
(correct and incorrect) of each of the four grades of certainty adopted
for this division of the experiment were made by each subject on each
card for each group on the card (shape, color, or letter or numeral).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
From these tabulations the tables that follow were in turn compiled.</p>

<p>The number of grades of certainty adopted for this division of
the experiment is obviously decidedly arbitrary. Grades of certainty
there surely are. The introspection of the subjects develops that
clearly, as has been stated. But there is no reason in the conditions of
the case for holding to the number four, as is done here. In giving the
results for which the experiment was undertaken, I shall, indeed, confine
myself to studying the range of the judgments made with as high
a grade of confidence as the subject believed he should ever have. This
is called certainty (1) or certainty proper. But for the tributary discussion
on the relation of certainty and error, the consideration of three
other grades used in the report and early tabulation, is also introduced.
This lowest grade (4) might better be named "as complete
uncertainty as will admit of one's making any judgment." The other
two are intermediate. It was at first intended to give the results with
regard to the effect of voluntary attention upon the place of these
grades of certainty, also, but such a discussion has been omitted because
it promised to add very little more than complexity to the report.
Besides this, the classification into these lower grades is too purely
approximate to make the distinction there of great value. For judgments
of the order certainty (1) we have the test, "Are you as certain
of this as you can imagine being in an experiment of this sort?" but no
such test for the other grades could be found. Yet, though he tended
to omit judgments of the lower grades of certainty, each subject
seemed to find four grades a convenient number to use in giving his
report.</p>

<p>The number of experiment cards used varied with the subjects. E
had so clear a memory of the cards that after as many as ten had been
shown, he found difficulty in distinguishing his memory of the one which
he had just seen from that of others seen earlier. Ten cards only were
used in his case. A, B, D, and F showed signs of fatigue after fifteen
cards which made the value of any later results questionable. C and K
showed no such signs of fatigue. The same set of cards was, of course,
shown any one subject for all four phases of the experiment. Those
omitted were the last ten or the last five of the complete set as the
case might be.</p>

<p>Table I answers the first part of our first problem promptly. Every
subject gave judgments of the order certainty (1) about groups other
than that attended to, in the case of a very considerable percentage of
the cards. True, again in the case of a considerable (though generally
smaller) percentage of those cards, each subject confined his judgments
to the group attended to. The fact of individual variation stands
out again here; and, moreover, the conclusions drawn should be
qualified slightly because of the fact that it was often possible for the
subjects to give all the letters and numerals on the cards, and still have,
as it were, some attention left over for the other, supposedly non-attended-to
groups. Such reaching beyond the properly attended-to
group never seemed to be possible with either shapes or colors. Aside
from this, however, it is clear that judgments of the highest grade of
certainty were by no means limited to the group attended to.</p>

<p>This same table answers, also, the second part of the problem.
Each subject found certainty of the highest grade sometimes stronger
outside than within the group which held his attention. It is, of course,
practically impossible to make absolutely certain that each subject's
attention was invariably held to the group toward which it was turned,
yet the percentage where certainty was stronger outside than within
such groups seems large enough, in some cases, at least, as with subjects
A, B, and H, to warrant our answering this second part of the problem
in the negative. I should feel, however, that this was answered
less definitely than was the first part of the problem. We may say, then,
that the judgments made with the highest degree of certainty about
a visual field will not be confined to the group attended to, and that
we have strong evidence pointing toward the belief that we cannot
expect there will invariably be more of such judgments within the
group attended to than outside it.</p>

<p>The most interesting part of this division of the experiment is
brought out in Table II in answer to the problem, "Will the place of
voluntary attention materially alter the distribution of judgments of
the highest order of certainty among the given groups?" In every case
the percentage is affected, in most cases, greatly affected. Take the
case of subject A, for instance. Although, when his attention is equally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
distributed over the field 59% of the judgments we consider were of
colors, yet when his attention was fixed on shapes and on letters and
numerals this fell to 5% and 20% respectively. When it was fixed on
colors, it rose, indeed, only to 61%. When, however, subject A fixed
his attention upon the letters and numerals, 61% of the judgments
were confined to the group attended to,&mdash;the same percentage as
when colors were the attended-to group,&mdash;although, when his attention
was distributed over the whole field, the percentage of these judgments
about the group of letters and numerals was 9% only. When shapes
were attended to, the 31% of the fourth phase of the experiment rose
to 94%,&mdash;almost all of the judgments of the highest grade of certainty
that were given were judgments about shapes. A similar study
of the results given in the table can be made for the other subjects. The
degree of change varies with the subject and with the group, but always
there is some change, and often a very marked one. In this
experiment the place of voluntary attention clearly did alter, and
alter materially, the proportion of judgments of the highest order of
certainty made about any given group.</p>

<p>That, indeed, would seem to me to be the answer of this experiment
to the question as to the effect of voluntary attention upon certainty
in one's judgments. Every subject showed a tendency to have more
certainty in those judgments which were made about that aspect of
the field toward which his attention was directed. Yet, on the other
hand, this was a tendency only, one not strong enough to make it
possible to predict beforehand exactly how great a proportion of the
judgments in which he had the highest degree of confidence would be
limited to that field, or even to be sure in every case that the greater
proportion of those judgments would be so limited. The place of
voluntary attention has an influence upon the subject-matter of the
judgments made with certainty about a visual field just seen, but an
influence of varying and uncertain strength.</p>

<p>The results given in Tables III and IV were compiled from the
same records as those of the two Tables just discussed. They give the
relation of error to certainty and to attention, as that relation was
developed in this experiment. No experiments were conducted with
these relations of error primarily in view, but the results developed in
connection with the problem of the effect of attention upon certainty
in one's judgments.</p>

<p>Both Tables show again marked individual variation. They suggest
to me, in the first place, a further line of investigation in the same
field and for the same purpose as those investigations which L. William
Stern outlines in an article<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> entitled <cite>Aussagestudium</cite>. This
further line is the testing subjects to learn the probable relative correctness
of the judgments made with different degrees of confidence.
Although a comparison of the first and third columns in Table IV makes
it clear that the proportion of mistakes for the highest grade of confidence
is lower than for the other grades taken together, there is a very
marked difference among the subjects to be noticed. The difference
in the two percentages is, for instance, very slight in the cases of D
and H, and very great in the case of E. It is interesting to notice
with regard to E that while he has the lowest percentage of mistakes
for certainty (1), he has the highest percentage for the group of certainties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
(2), (3), and (4). In the more detailed percentages given in
Table III we see further that in certain fields and sometimes in all
fields (as with subject C) judgments made with the lowest grade
of confidence were invariably correct. Such Tables might be of help
in a case where the evidence of eye-witnesses conflicted. We might
perhaps learn that witness N made a large proportion of mistakes
where he was absolutely certain, whereas witness M was seldom
wrong in judgments in which he had a low degree of confidence. Even
when the probity of both was unquestioned, we should not then assume
that N was more probably right because he had so much more
confidence in his judgments than M had in his. A much longer and
more comprehensive set of experiments would be necessary before we
could feel that we had at hand a table from which to work in this
way.</p>

<p>The question of the effect of voluntary attention upon error, for
answering which Table IV was compiled, brings out again the marked
individual variation among these seven subjects which has shown
itself in practically all parts of the experiment. Some effect seems to
have been produced always, but this was sometimes to give a larger
percentage of mistakes in the attended-to groups and sometimes a
smaller. With A, B, and F the percentage of mistakes in certainty
(1) was lower for the groups attended to than for the total number of
judgments of that order. Only with subject B, however, is this true of
the group of lower grades of certainties also. On the other hand, with
subjects C, D, E, and H the percentage is greater for certainty (1) in
the groups attended to than for certainty (1) in the collection of all the
judgments of certainty (1) taken together. Here, too, in the case of
subject D, the results with regard to the lower grades of certainty reverse
those for certainty (1). Thus all four possibilities as to the kind
of influence of voluntary attention upon certainty appear. We cannot
say that the place of voluntary attention will tend to affect the percentage
of error in any given way. We can only say that apparently
it made some difference with each subject. It might be found by further
experimenting that the character of this difference is associated with
some other characteristic of either attention or the feeling of certainty,
as, for instance, with the ease with which attention is held to the
chosen field or with the type of the subject's certainty.</p>

<p>Like all experiments, these open up further questions quite as much
as they answer those toward which they are aimed. To repeat something
of what has already been said, I feel that what it has established
is (1) that introspection develops distinct grades of certainty in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
case of every individual, (2) that the particular characteristics of the
feeling of certainty vary markedly among individuals; (3) that the
feelings of certainty associated with the different senses are not, as
feelings of certainty, to be distinguished from each other; (4) that the
judgments of the highest degree of certainty which are made about
the constitution of any visual field just seen will not be confined to the
group in that field toward which the attention is directed; and (5)
that such fixing of the attention will, nevertheless, materially alter the
subject-matter of such judgments of greatest certainty. The rather
vague statement that the percentage of error is not surely less with the
judgments of a group because attention is fixed on that group may
perhaps be added as a sixth conclusion. The most interesting and
promising of the problems which the experiments seem to me to raise
are: (1) the problem, are there such definite types of the feeling of certainty
that people may be classified according to their types, and, if so,
what are the types and what their relation to other psychological characteristics
of the individual? (2) the problem, what will be the result
of careful and trained introspection as to the relation of so-called logical
and psychological certainty and in what fields do these appear for
different individuals? (3) the problem, how can a test for grading the
probable percentage of error in the judgments of different grades of
certainty made by any one person be constructed? and (4) the problem,
how are such facts as those given in Table IV to be connected
with the effort required for attention, the type of certainty of each subject,
etc.? Other problems could, of course, be suggested, but these,
I feel, mark the steps that naturally follow the experiments described
here.</p>

<p>Experiments made by Ranschburg<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> on the significance of similars
in the process of learning and remembering determined that
when duplicates occur within a series of stimuli, one either totally
or very greatly inhibits the perception of the other according as they
are contiguous or are separated by other stimuli. Dr. Yerkes,<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> in
testing the effect of auditory on visual and tactual stimuli in frogs,
found that if the auditory stimulus preceded another stimulus by
various time-intervals, it had an alternating reÃ«nforcing and inhibitory
effect. A similar result was obtained by Hofbauer<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> in a similar
experiment on human subjects. The question now arises,&mdash;if the
time-interval were increased between a stimulus and its duplicate
in a series would the inhibitory effect gradually approach zero where
all effect of the preceding stimulus ceased, to which Ranschburg's
experiments point, or would the inhibitory effect be alternated with
one of reÃ«nforcement as the experiments of Dr. Yerkes and Hofbauer
would indicate? This problem&mdash;the effect of a stimulus on its
duplicate in a succeeding series of stimuli&mdash;is the problem I undertook
to solve. For this purpose, it was necessary to introduce exactly
determinable time-intervals between the stimulus and its duplicate.
Therefore I used&mdash;as Miss Kleinknecht<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> did for other purposes&mdash;a
stroboscopic arrangement instead of simultaneous presentation
which Ranschburg used.</p>

<p>My apparatus was Professor MÃ¼nsterberg's Stereoscope without
Prisms or Lenses, a description and photograph of which was published<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
in the article by that title in Psychological Review, vol. 1;
or rather, I used Professor MÃ¼nsterberg's attachment to Kohl's
centrifugal machine, since my apparatus was not identical, except
in principle, with the "Stereoscope." The "attachment" consists
of two black discs about thirty inches in diameter, mounted about
eight inches apart on the disc-shaft of the centrifugal machine. The
back disc is of wood. The outer three inches of its face is furnished
with thirty-six equidistant strips of black tin, one end of each of which
is bent so as to grip a groove in the rim of the disc, and the other
end of each is gripped by tiny thumb-screws so that the strips lie
along radii of the face of the disc. The front disc, slightly smaller
than the back disc, is of pasteboard. Between the two discs a stationary
black screen with a short narrow slit was placed so that the slit
revealed only the strip on the horizontal radius of the back disc.
Behind this screen an eight-candle-power electric light was placed
to illuminate the back disc,&mdash;as the experiment was carried on in
a darkened room. By moving this light I was enabled to vary the
intensity of illumination to offset the skill of the observer.</p>

<p>For my purpose, a small white figure&mdash;one of the ten characters
of the Arabic notation&mdash;was stuck on about the middle of each
of the tin strips on the back disc; and radial slits, one millimetre
wide and an inch long, were cut from one sixth of the circumference
of the front disc so as to come opposite six of the strips on the back
disc. Similar radial slits were cut at various intervals from the remaining
five sixths of the circumference of the front disc. These
were covered by small pieces of cardboard fastened to niagara clips,
thus making them readily removeable. By this means any desired
figure could be exposed in the same revolution with the series exposed
by the six slits above mentioned.</p>

<p>The thirty-six strips were divided into six series of six each, indicated
by chalk-marks on the disc. Each of the series was often changed
in whole or in part by shifting and interchanging the strips.</p>

<p>The figure on which the effect of a preceding stimulus was tested
occupied the fourth place in the series, since this is the place where
the greatest number of errors occur, as is shown by the experiments
of Ranschburg and previous investigators in the Harvard Laboratory.
In my experiment, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 occupied the fourth
place in the 1st, 2d, 3d, 4th, 5th, and 6th series respectively, and the
effect of a preceding stimulus was tried on each of these figures for
each time-interval. The preceding stimulus in each case was a duplicate
of the fourth member of a series, and was a member of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
other series. Thus the fourth member of each series was at all times
fixed and constant while the preceding stimulus occupied successive
progressive positions round the disc. The other members of each
series were chosen at random, care being taken that the fourth figure
was not duplicated within its series, since it would then have taken
part in inhibition within the series.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="caption">P<span class="smcapa">LATE</span> IX.</p></div>
</div>

<p>By adjusting the front disc, I exposed any one of the series desired,
and by removing the cardboard blind from one of the suggestion
slits, I gave a stimulus at the desired time-interval in advance
of the fourth member of the series. The first interval I used was
1.11 sec. as Miss Kleinknecht had tried intervals up to 1 sec. My
second interval was 1.39 sec., the third 1.8 sec., and then every .277
sec. up to 4.3 sec. In performing the experiment I exposed alternately
a series without and a series with a preceding stimulus&mdash;taking from
the observer three reports of each&mdash;until the six series had been seen.
I then repeated this, exposing with a preceding stimulus those series
that had been exposed without preceding stimulus, and without preceding
stimulus those series that had been exposed with a preceding
stimulus in the first instance. In this way I equalized and minimized
the effects of novelty and memory.</p>

<p>At 1.11 sec. there was considerable inhibition in five out of six
cases. In the sixth case there was slight reÃ«nforcement at this interval.
With an interval of 1.39 sec., with one exception,&mdash;not the exception
above mentioned,&mdash;there was a stronger inhibition than
at 1.11 sec. Inhibition in all cases began to decrease from 1.39 sec.
until it ceased at about 1.8 sec. The preceding stimulus then had
a reÃ«nforcing effect which reached a maximum in four cases at 2.08
sec., one at 2.36 sec., and one at 2.64 sec. Then, in all cases, there
was a decrease of the reÃ«nforcing effect which in three cases amounted
to inhibition. In the other three cases, the preceding stimulus had
no inhibitory effect for an interval greater than 1.8 sec. For one of
these, Fig. 5, the preceding stimulus had a reÃ«nforcing effect for all
the intervals beyond 1.8 sec. The second trough in the wave or interval
of maximum inhibition was at either 2.64 sec. or 2.92 sec.,
except for the person for whom there was constant reÃ«nforcement
beyond 1.8 sec., in which case the first interval of least reÃ«nforcement
or second trough was at 3.19 sec. This was the second interval of
greatest enhancement, or second crest, for four of the others. Then
followed a third point of no effect or inhibition, which was 3.75 sec.
or 4.03 sec. For the person for whom the preceding stimulus had
least enhancing effect at 3.19 sec., the second interval of greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
reÃ«nforcement coincided with the interval of greatest inhibition
for the majority of the other observers. For four of the six observers,
the third interval of greatest reÃ«nforcement was 4.3 sec. In this, the
observer agreed for whom the last interval of greatest reÃ«nforcement
was 3.75 sec. Thus while, for this observer, the first two points of
greatest reÃ«nforcement were separated by an interval of 1.11 sec.,
the second and third points were separated by an interval of only
.55 sec. This same thing occurred in the records of two other observers,
for one at this point, and for the other at another point.
Of the two dissenters from the opinion of the majority that the third
crest was at 4.3 sec., one was an erratic observer; and for the other,
there was a slight reÃ«nforcement at 4.03 sec. and no effect at all at
4.3 sec.</p>

<p>Fig. 1 represents the average of the records of the six observers.
The curve is based on the difference between the number of times
the fourth members of the series were seen with and without preceding
stimulus. The base-line represents the number of times the
figure was seen without preceding stimulus, taken each day as the
normal for that day. Figures above the base-line represent the greater,
and those below the line, the less number of times the figure was
seen with preceding stimulus, or reÃ«nforcement and inhibition, respectively.
The first two points are the average of fifty-four observations;
each point beyond the second is the average of 108 observations.
Figs. 2, 3, 4, and 5 represent individual records constructed
as Fig. 1, each point being the average of eighteen observations.</p>

<p>The curve in Fig. 1 is somewhat misleading in showing points of
maximum reÃ«nforcement at 3.19 sec., 3.75 sec., and 4.3 sec. In no
individual case was this true. The reason for the crest at 3.75 sec.,
or at least for its height, is that in two cases reÃ«nforcement was considerable
at this interval, and there was little inhibition to offset
this in the general average. At 3.19 sec., which was the second interval
of greatest reÃ«nforcement, for four out of the six observers,
owing to practice, the reÃ«nforcement was not great (Fig. 4), but in
no case was there inhibition at this point. Thus for the lack of strong
positive effect at 3.19 sec. and the lack of strong negative effect at
3.75 sec., the two crests are the same height, while the first represents
the maximum effect for four and the second for two observers.</p>

<p>From these results, taking everything into consideration, my conclusions
are:</p>

<p>(1) If a stimulus precedes at various time-intervals its duplicate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
in a series of stimuli, it will alternately inhibit and reÃ«nforce the perceiving
of the duplicate stimulus.</p>

<p>(2) Within 4.5 sec. there are at least three points each of maximum
inhibition and maximum reÃ«nforcement.</p>

<p>(3) The points of maximum inhibition and likewise those of maximum
reÃ«nforcement are separated by intervals of from .55 sec. to
1.2 sec.&mdash;more often by one of the two extremes than by any mean.</p>

<p>(4) Up to 4.5 sec., as the time-interval increases, the maximum
inhibition generally decreases, while the maximum enhancement
correspondingly increases.</p>

<p>What the limit of this periodic effect is, I cannot as yet say, as
up to the present I have not used time-intervals beyond 4.3 sec.
But from the intensity of the effect at this interval, I do not expect
the limit to be within several seconds.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_INTERFERENCE_OF_OPTICAL_STIMULI" id="THE_INTERFERENCE_OF_OPTICAL_STIMULI"></a>THE INTERFERENCE OF OPTICAL STIMULI</h2>

<p class="p1b">BY H. KLEINKNECHT</p>


<p>The purpose of this investigation is the determination of the location,
extent, nature, and cause of the interference of optical stimuli.
Ranschburg<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> studied the phenomena carefully in using optical
stimuli which were spread over the retinal field, for instance, a series
of letters or figures one beside the other. But if we are to experiment
on the inhibitory influence of a certain qualitative impression, we
must try to eliminate the local difference; the letters or figures ought
to be seen at the same spot.</p>

<p>This became possible by a stroboscopic arrangement, consisting of
two parallel circular discs one foot apart on the same axis, whose
motion was controlled by an electric current.</p>

<p>The discs were 60 cm. in diameter. Thirty-six radii were drawn
equidistant on the farther disc, and on these were clasped black tin
strips bearing letters or numbers or colors. The nearer disc was similarly
divided and an opening, 3 mm. in width, was cut at each radius.
This exposed the number. A cardboard placed between the discs
limited the range of vision, its opening being 4 Ã 5 cm.</p>

<p>The figures were 10 mm. high, white, and placed on a dark background.</p>

<p>Preparatory stimuli were given to enable the subject to adjust his
eye to the farther disc. They were so placed as to fall on different
retinal points, thus avoiding fatigue.</p>

<p>Many of the tests employed by Ranschburg were used again to
ascertain the influence of the change in method and with the hope
that such differences might throw some light on the nature of the
interference. At first there were six subjects, afterwards eight&mdash;all
graduate students and trained in laboratory work. The experiment
was carried on in the morning. Numbers consisting of six digits were
exposed on a dark background. The time of exposure varied with the
subject, but was constant throughout the experiment. The subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
was asked to record the number immediately after perceiving it, but
in almost every case it was read verbally (its retention being thus
facilitated) and then recorded.</p>

<p>For the first few weeks letters were used. But since subjects found it
very difficult to distinguish these, a change was made to figures. For
a month and a half numbers were given for the purpose of training
the subjects and of ascertaining the speed best adapted to each. This
varied from 5Â½" to 8" a revolution, each figure being exposed from
115 to 166 sigma.</p>

<p>Three series of numbers were given: (1) Homogeneous, containing
a repeated figure, as, 495851. (2) Heterogeneous; as, 708654. (3) Similar,
that is, in construction; as, 813470 (8 and 3 being easily substituted
for each other). Other similars given by Ranschburg are 9
and 0, 9 and 6, 9 and 2, and 5 and 3.</p>

<p>In order to determine the place of greatest interference, the repeated
figures were located in all possible positions, while the preceding
and succeeding figures were left unaltered, so as to obviate any new
influences which might result from a change of relations. There are
fifteen possible variations of the series: <em>mabcdm</em>, <em>ambcdm</em>, <em>abmcdm</em>,
<em>abcmdm</em>, <em>abcdmm</em>, etc.</p>

<p>The following table, illustrative of the scheme <em>ambmcd</em>, will show
the character of the results obtained. Only the numbers in which
errors occur are here recorded, those figures which were incorrectly
perceived being printed in heavy type. The dash is used when the
location of the figure omitted is known, and the interrogation mark
when the reply is doubtful.</p>

<p>The interference may result in permutation, substitution, or
inhibition. The latter two may take several forms; as, inhibition of
identicals, of similars, of dissimilars, the location of the omitted
figure being known or unknown; also, substitution of an identical,
similar, or dissimilar figure which precedes or follows.</p>

<p class="p2b">I. <em>Inhibition</em></p>

<p>(1) There is considerable inhibition only when identicals are next
to each other.</p>

<p>(2) There is but little difference in the amount of inhibition when
identicals are removed two and when removed three places.</p>

<p>(3) The interference is greatest when 3d = 4th, 4th = 5th, and
5th = 6th figures, in which schemes it is almost equal in amount.</p>

<p>(4) When identicals are adjacent, it is impossible to decide whether
there be inhibition or fusion, <em>i. e.</em>, whether one be inhibited and the
other appear, or whether the figure seen be a fusion of the two (unless
there is an omitted figure whose location is known to the subject).
Its intensity does not serve as a clue, for the perception of the number
demands the full concentration of the attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span></p>


<p class="p2b">II. <em>Substitution</em></p>

<p>When the interference is not sufficiently great to cause inhibition,
substitution may result.</p>

<p>(1) In the majority of cases the substituted figure is a dissimilar
not occurring in the number.</p>

<p>(2) A preceding figure is frequently substituted.</p>

<p>(3) Occasionally a figure is replaced by its similar, but this is not
true of the homogeneous element. (Cf. with Ranschburg.)</p>

<p>(4) Sometimes the next figure in the natural number series is
substituted; as, 9 for 8, 6 for 5.</p>

<p>(5) The figures containing straight lines (4, 7, and especially 1)
are less subject to illusion; likewise the smaller numbers (1, 2, 3, 4).</p>


<p class="p2b">III. <em>Permutation</em></p>

<p>The permutation represents the least interference.</p>

<p>(1) The 4th and 5th figures are most often exchanged.</p>

<p>(2) The figure is seldom permuted more than two places, and
generally but one.</p>

<p>The recording of the number was most interesting. Generally the
first few figures and the last were written without comment, but the
4th and 5th often called forth an expression of doubt, which was
immediately followed by an exclamation at the coming of the figure
into consciousness as if by "inspiration." The experience was
extremely peculiar. The figure, fully as distinct as those already perceived,
was always from 5â³ to 10â³ late, and seemed to "pop in
unannounced"&mdash;to "come from nowhere." A substitution or
permutation occurred without this lapse of time.</p>


<p class="p6">H<span class="smcapa">ETEROGENEOUS</span> S<span class="smcapa">ERIES</span></p>

<p>(1) There are less than half as many inhibitions as in the homogeneous
series, the largest number being in the 4th and 5th places.</p>

<p>(2) The number of substitutions is decreased by a fourth, the
identicals and similars remaining the same.</p>

<p>(3) There are no fusions.</p>

<p>(4) Fewer permutations are found in this series. The 4th and 5th
figures are most often permuted. In a very few cases the figure is
permuted four and five places.</p>

<p>(5) There are an equal number of doubtful perceptions in both
series.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span></p>


<p class="p6">S<span class="smcapa">IMILAR</span> S<span class="smcapa">ERIES</span></p>

<p>(1) There are few cases of inhibition, and even more surprising
is the small number of cases in which a figure is inhibited by its
similar.</p>

<p>(2) There are more substitutions, 6 being very often substituted
for 5, generally in the 6th place and when preceded by 0 or 9, often
by both. Similars are never replaced by identicals (69 by 66 or 99) as
Ranschburg found in his experiments.</p>

<p>(3) The fusion of similars equals that of identicals in the homogeneous
series.</p>

<p>(4) The number of permutations is the same as in the homogeneous
series and less than in the heterogeneous.</p>

<p>(5) The doubtful perceptions have decreased by half.</p>

<p>That there are fewer errors in this series than in the homogeneous
or heterogeneous, may be due to the fact that it was given last, especially
since one subject showed marked improvement in the entire
series and another during the last half. These subjects suddenly
began to see six figures, while previously they had seen but five and
those contained errors.</p>

<p>In the above 1620 tests, 9 and 0, and 8 and 3, are sometimes inhibited
by and substituted for each other, but the remaining similars
mentioned by Ranschburg seldom have any such effect.</p>

<p>It is impossible to determine definitely the nature of the interference,
the greatest uncertainty existing in the homogeneous series when two
identicals are adjacent. But the interference is dependent not only
upon the identity or similarity of the figures of which the number is
composed but also upon their location.</p>

<p class="p6">C<span class="smcapa">OLORS</span></p>

<p>In the hope that some light might be thrown upon the main question
at issue, the writer changed the stimuli, using colors instead of
numbers.</p>

<p>It was important that the colors should be of the same or only
slightly varying intensity and that they should be easily distinguishable.
In a series of preliminary experiments in which red, blue,
yellow, green, brown, gray, pink, and violet were used, red was lost
in 8% of the tests, and gray in 25%.</p>

<p>Colors 1Ã4 cm. in size "ran into each other," while those which
were 1Ã1 cm. remained distinct.</p>

<p>Here it was found necessary to distinguish between the various
factors which might cause inhibition. Three factors entered into
each test&mdash;perceiving, naming, remembering.</p>

<p>Four subjects found difficulty in naming, especially at first. The
various methods of naming are given below in detail. M. says: "The
name of the color is localized in my mouth. Generally there is no
movement of the tongue&mdash;an impulse only; and the name is felt in
that part of the mouth where the sound would be reflected, as, red in
the upper part, blue near the front, etc."</p>

<p>S.: "Usually there is no apparent tendency to pronounce. Occasionally,
naming them over inaudibly before recording is found
advantageous."</p>

<p>E., V., and H.: "The naming is mental, but is accompanied by
a slight movement of the tongue and throat."</p>

<p>684 heterogeneous and 200 homogeneous tests showed that greatest
inhibition occurred in the following order: 4th place (27%), 3d
(26%), 5th (24%), 2d (11%), 6th (8%), 1st (4%). There was
but little difference in the 3d, 4th, and 5th places.</p>

<p>During first tests subjects were allowed only one exposure, but
later it was thought best to eliminate all omissions resulting from
inability to name colors perceived, and hence they were asked to
record only when able to name all colors perceived during that exposure.
However several required but one exposure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span></p>

<p>Preliminary drill was given for two weeks. Since no clear cases of
fusion had been obtained in the entire number-series, the one aim of
the experimenter was to ascertain whether fusion of colors, even
though of heterogeneous, be possible. Eight hundred heterogeneous
tests gave 927 cases of inhibition, 7 of fusion, and 18 which, though
somewhat doubtful, yet gave more evidence of fusion than of inhibition.
Yellow (3d place) and brown (6th place) were seen as yellowish-brown,
brown and pink as pinkish-brown, etc. Gray was seen several
times instead of a color and its complementary when these were in
immediate succession. This was true of both red and blue. Half
of the total number of substitutions was due to the displacement of
yellow by brown. And a color not in the series was as likely to be
substituted as one preceding or following the displaced color.</p>

<p>Two hundred and fifty-two homogeneous tests showed that there
is greatest interference when identicals are in immediate succession,
and least, when removed two places. The doubtful (fusion?) cases
number <em>one third</em> of the inhibited. The 4th and 5th colors are
permuted most often, as was found to be the case in the heterogeneous
series also. The element is generally permuted but one place.</p>

<p>The heterogeneous color-tests show three times as much interference
as the corresponding number-tests, and the homogeneous
twice as much. The discrepancy in the amount of variation may be
due to the experiments with the heterogeneous colors being earlier,
when naturally more errors would be made.</p>

<p>However, a comparison of 252 homogeneous with the same number
of heterogeneous tests, taken at the same time, shows that there
is a much larger difference in the number of absolute errors between
the heterogeneous and the homogeneous number-series than there is,
proportionately, between the two series of color-tests.</p>

<p>Lest the want of correspondence in the results might have been due
to the comparatively small number of immediately successive identicals
in the color-tests, 90 homogeneous tests, equally distributed
among all possible variations in the location of the identical elements,
were compared with 90 heterogeneous, and it was unexpectedly
found that the absolute errors as well as the permutations were
almost equal in the two series. Nevertheless, the validity of a conclusion
based on so few tests may well be questioned.</p>

<p>Ranschburg found that simultaneous homogeneous stimuli interfere
with one another; while simultaneous heterogeneous stimuli
clear the way for one another. On the basis of the experiments with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
numbers, the writer would amend the conclusion reached in the earlier
research to read thus: Homogeneous optical stimuli, whether occurring
simultaneously in different positions, or in immediate succession
in the same positions, interfere with one another; while heterogeneous
stimuli clear the way for one another.</p>

<h2><a name="SUBJECTIVE_AND_OBJECTIVE_SIMULTANEITY" id="SUBJECTIVE_AND_OBJECTIVE_SIMULTANEITY"></a>SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE SIMULTANEITY</h2>

<p class="p1b">BY THOMAS H. HAINES</p>


<p>This investigation finds its starting-points in two widely separated
lines of experimentation in the problems of attention. These two
lines are the "scope-of-attention" experiment with the tachistoscope,
and the "time-displacement" experiment with the pendulum
apparatus. It seems to me these two can be brought into relation to
each other to the help of each of them individually, and that an investigation
taking these wide relations within its scope may reasonably
be expected to throw new light upon the manner in which mental
processes are related to each other when they are together in consciousness
at the same time. The first of these experiments (tachistoscopic)
is concerned with the number and relative clearness of the
processes which go on at the same time. The second (displacement)
is concerned with the conditions of the subjective displacement of
one of two objectively simultaneous stimuli with reference to the
other. Its problem is the essential psychological problem involved in
the astronomer's error in transit observations by the eye-and-ear
method, for the personal equation arising in these observations is
more a matter of the reciprocal relations among the processes which
are together in consciousness at the moment of observation than it
is of mere reaction time. It is primarily more a matter of relative
clearness, as controlled probably through interference of one with
another, than it is of the more or less temperamental facility of converting
ideas into action.</p>

<p>The psychological question at the heart of the observation-error,
called the personal equation, is this,&mdash;What are the conditions
which hinder such a division of attention among the parts of the
complex operation of coÃ¶rdinating sense-stimulations, that the processes
which start simultaneously may proceed to equal clearness
at the same time, and so be perceived as simultaneous? The facts
sought in order to answer this question are the very same as some of
those, at least, demanded by the "scope-of-attention" investigation
when it really opens up to its true problem. W. Wirth<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> has recently
shown, in an exhaustive criticism of the tachistoscopic method, that
"scope of attention" is primarily concerned with the <em>relations</em> of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
the processes present together, and that this demands a previous
exhaustive study of their <em>relative clearnesses</em>. Earlier studies by the
tachistoscopic method, as, for example those of Cattell<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> on the
relatively short time for the perception of letters in words, as compared
with that for separate letters, and the overlapping of processes
in continuous reading, showed that the important question is, <em>what</em>
are the processes which may go on at the same time. Leaving out
a statement of the nature of the processes is equivalent to leaving
out one of the dimensions when endeavoring to state the contents of
a solid. The scope of attention can be defined adequately only when
one knows fully <em>what</em> the separate processes are as well as <em>how many</em>
there are. This analysis, which the scope-of-attention problem demands,
cannot fail to be directly fruitful for the solution of the time-displacement
problem. The analysis of this larger problem directly
involves the former. Any attempt to investigate the time-displacement
of sense-impressions from simultaneous stimuli must inevitably
place the highest value upon the whole detailed analysis of any moment
of attentive effort.</p>

<p>The present investigation, starting with the facts of time-displacement,
and taking the hint offered by Gonnessiat,<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> attempts to
show, by a more complete analysis, the effects of the various relations
within each series,&mdash;the visual within which the sounds are to be
placed, and the auditory series itself, and also relations existing
between the two series. In other words, the attempt is made to strip
the "displacement" experiment until nothing more remains to be
coÃ¶rdinated than a single pair of simultaneous stimuli. This was
the experiment of Exner.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> He investigated the shortest discriminable
interval marked off by various pairs of stimuli, addressed to the
same sense and to different senses. From this coÃ¶rdination of a
visual and an auditory stimulus, where the limits of the "specious
present" are obtained, I make a turn into the realm of the scope
of attention. By a new method, whereby impairment of accuracy of
processes is made the test as to whether the processes have proceeded
together, it is shown that two such perceptual processes can go on
just about as well at the same time as separately. Since this test is
subject to the objection that the visual and auditory processes may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
really be successive, though seemingly at the same time, owing to
retinal inertia, the same question is removed to an entirely different
plane in a further and more detailed set of experiments where the
processes combined are <em>judgments of comparison</em> based upon one
and the same visual sensation.</p>

<p>The Leipsic Complication Experiment with the pendulum apparatus
(for description of this see Wundt's Physiol. Psy., 5th ed., vol. 3,
p. 82) was an early adaptation of the astronomers' eye-and-ear
method to the purposes of psychological experimentation. Instead
of localizing a visual stimulus (star on meridian) in an auditory
series (clicks of a chronoscope) as in the eye-and-ear method, this
adaptation localized an auditory stimulus (bell-stroke) in a visual
series (successive positions of a pointer on a graduated circle). This
pointer passed around to the right and to the left from the position
of rest, in which it pointed vertically upward, as the pendulum, to
which it was connected by clockwork, swung back and forth. By a
simple adjustment the bell-stroke could be made to come at any point
in the complete double swing of the pendulum, and so anywhere in
the arc over which the pointer moved. This machine makes an
additional problem as to the effects upon displacement of the increasing
and decreasing speed. My aim being to simplify as much as
possible the displacement-error and so reduce it to its elements, this
feature was not only not of direct interest, but it was very desirable
to dispense with it altogether. This was done by arranging the visual
series so that the members were shown in perfectly regular order, <em>i. e.</em>
with equal time-intervals, throughout the series. These equal intervals
were secured by the rotation of a disc at a uniform rate.</p>

<p>My method also gave a more distinctly serial character to the
visual stimuli, in that they were separated by blank periods. The
series consisted of letters in alphabetical order. Denison's smallest
white letters, about six millimetres in height, were pasted upon a
disc of black cardboard, near the circumference and perpendicular
to radii, so that they would appear in succession and right side up,
to an observer looking through a slit at the peripheral region of the
disc, as it rotated. The letters were placed in three concentric rows,
so that as the disc rotated they appeared in three different places.
The disc was 56.5 cm. in diameter. As a further aid in securing
separate exhibitions of letters, another black disc of the same size as
the one bearing the letters, with radial slits 2 mm. wide and cut in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
from the edge 4 cm., opposite each letter on the other disc, was
mounted on the same shaft, six inches from the first, and between
it and the observer. A short observation-tube was placed at the same
height as the axis of the discs parallel to this axis, and opposite the
slits when they were at this elevation. Looking through this, as
the discs were rotated, one would see the letters right side up and
in serial succession. Uniform illumination was secured by working in
a dark room with artificial light. An electric lamp was hung between
the discs. Uniform motion was secured by an automatic control
gravity motor, connected by belt with a pulley on the disc-shaft.</p>

<p>The auditory stimulus, a click, adjustable to any part of the series,
was made as follows: A wooden shaft, mounted on the same axle
as the discs, and beyond the discs from the observer, could be rotated
freely around the axle when the nut securing it was loosened. This
shaft extended beyond the edge of the disc. It carried a copper
wire which was in contact with the axle. A mercury cup was placed
on the table, upon which the machine rested, in such position that
the copper tip passed through the mercury when the discs rotated.
It was thus a very simple matter to connect an electric sounder so
that it would click every time the circuit was made by the copper
passing through the mercury. And, by the adjustment of the wooden
shaft, the click was readily placed anywhere in the visual series.</p>

<p>As already suggested above, the length of interval between members
of the visual series, and also the time between clicks, seem to
be important factors in determining the amount, and perhaps also
the direction of the displacement. Bessel found his personal equation
was considerably diminished when he used a clock marking
half-seconds instead of one marking seconds. Wolf also diminished
his error by using a clock beating one hundred times a minute instead
of one beating seconds, which he was accustomed to use. Wundt
found his customary negative displacement on the pendulum apparatus
(coÃ¶rdinating the sound with a position of the index earlier
than that with which it was actually simultaneous) disappeared
when he had members of the visual series one thirty-sixth second
apart and the auditory stimuli one second apart. It seemed important
at the outset, therefore, to determine, if possible, the effects of
each of these factors.</p>

<p>In each experiment the observer was allowed to observe as many
complications (coincidences of click and letter) as he desired, in order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
to assure himself of his judgment. The experimenter counted and
recorded the number observed in each experiment. Experiments
were made in series of ten. Six different combinations of intervals
were used in this first group of experiments. The auditory intervals
(time between successive clicks) and visual intervals (time between
successive members of the visual series) are given at the tops of the
columns in Table I. This table is a summary presentation of the
results of this group. There were three observers. During each hour
of experimentation with a given observer, at least one series with
each of the first four time-interval combinations was tried out.
"Aver. num. Trials" means the average number of complications
observed in the whole number of tests averaged. "Num. Series av."
means the number of series of ten experiments each averaged to
give the displacement results below. "Aver. Error" is the average
of all the displacements of the auditory impression, <em>irrespective of
the direction of the displacement</em>. "Mean Displacement" is the <em>actual
mean displacement</em> as obtained by dividing the algebraic sum of all
displacements, positive and negative, by the number of experiments.
The plus sign indicates a positive displacement, and the minus sign,
a negative. Negative and positive are here used in the sense customary
in similar experiments,&mdash;namely, the click, being heard as
simultaneous with a visual impression which actually came before it,
was said to be displaced negatively, and the click, being heard as
simultaneous with a visual impression coming in fact later than it
did, was said to be displaced positively. Average errors and mean
displacements are given in the table in thousandths of seconds.
Observers were asked to locate the click in the visual series in terms
of one tenth the distance or time between the letters.</p>

<p>The first four combinations of intervals above, with which the
major part of the results was obtained, it will be noticed, are approximately
proportionate increases in each interval, column by column.
These conditions were planned with a view to revealing the conditions,
most favorable for coÃ¶rdinating the auditory and visual impressions,
for each observer, so that his displacement would disappear,
or show a tendency to disappear. So far as is shown by these results,
there are here two types of observer. Bo has no mean displacement
for the 8.40-.260 sec. combination, and it steadily decreases toward
this point as the two intervals increase. Both B and M, on the other
hand, have a considerable positive mean displacement for the 1.28-.040
sec. combination, and a considerable negative mean displacement
for the 2.56-.080 sec. combination, and there is a further
increase in the negative displacement as the intervals increase from
this point. It seems as though these observers would give a mean
displacement of zero for some combination of intervals between these
first two. It will be noticed that the average number of trials is exceptionally
large for all three of the observers in the first combination.
This seemed to be pretty clearly due to the very short interval separating
visual impressions.</p>

<p>In order more certainly to isolate the influence of the time-interval
between successive auditory impressions, another series of experiments
was performed, in which this interval between clicks, alone, was varied
from series to series. The visual interval was kept at .083 sec. throughout.
This seemed to be about the shortest time-separation at which
the successive impressions were perfectly distinct. The auditory
impressions were at 1, 1Â½, 2, 3, and 4 sec. intervals. The additional
observer, H, was myself. I obtained these results by experimenting
alone. I adjusted the wooden shaft carelessly to a new position
and started the machine. When speed was attained, I would make the
observation just as an observer for whom the adjustment had been
made. I would have as little idea beforehand as he with regard to
the position of the click in the series of letters. Having made the
observation, however, I measured the actual place of the sound and
recorded it, as well as my judgment. In this way, of course, I had
some idea, all the time, as to what kind of displacements I was
making and how large. I was as careless of this knowledge as possible,
and the records were laid aside absolutely, until I was through
with the whole experiment. Terms used in Table II are the same
as in Table I.</p>

<p>One series of ten of each of these combinations was given during
each hour of experimentation with each observer. These were also
given in a different order each day, so that no combination should
have the advantage, by practice or lack of fatigue, in the average
of the ten series. Here again it was evident, in the records of each of
the observers for whom the count was made, that the largest number
of trials was necessary in the 1-.083 sec. combination. It thus appears
that it was not the short visual interval, .040, in Table I, that
was responsible for the large number of trials necessary in the first
combination. Here, where there is the same visual interval of .083
sec. throughout, it must be the short auditory interval which makes
particularly difficult conditions for attention. This agreement between
the results in both groups of experiments seems to indicate
unfavorable conditions for accurate coÃ¶rdination at auditory intervals
as short as one second. The large changes in the mean displacement
for B and M between the first two combinations in the
first group (Table I) was kept especially in mind in planning this
second series of combined intervals. It was presumed from the results
given by these observers in Table I that they would each, with
the range of auditory interval presented them in these experiments,
show a point of no displacement, or a very slight one, and an increasing
displacement on each side of this point. They both seemed
to indicate a time-interval favorable for the "ripening of apperception"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
as Wundt and Von Tschisch call it, and I planned these experiments
especially to bring it out more clearly. But there is far less
indication of a time most favorable for "ripening" than in the previous
group of experiments. B and M both give all mean displacements
as positive, and decidedly small differences in displacement
for the various combinations. Results of Bo are, however, entirely
consistent with those of Table I. H gives a very small negative mean
displacement throughout. This, as well as the smallness of the average
error, may be due to the knowledge of results which I had.</p>

<p>An examination of the detailed daily results, which cannot be
exhibited here, shows considerable change in the direction of the
displacements as the work proceeded. This is especially marked in
the case of B, who, during the first two hours of experimentation,
gave only negative displacements. Through the rest of the first group
there was a gradual increase of positive displacements, and in the
last two hours about 90% were positive. In the second group he
did not give a single negative displacement. The same change is
manifested in the results of M for the first group; but he did not
change over nearly so completely. In the five hundred experiments
of Table II, for M, there are three hundred and ninety-two positive,
sixty-seven negative, and forty-one <em>no</em> displacements. Bo gave a
number of positive displacements from the start. These increased
considerably in the second over the first group, showing only thirty-seven
negative displacements in the second group. This change in
the direction of the displacement, rather independently of the intervals,
is an interference with the main purpose of the experiment.
It may represent the effect of practice.</p>

<p>Angell and Pierce<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> found the same progressive change from negative
to positive displacements. They explained it as a change in the
focus of attention. The visual series is focal at first, and the sound
becomes focal in later experiments. Negative displacements result
from fixing the last possible point in the visual series before the
sound is heard, while positive displacements result from getting the
first letter possible after the sound. The method of my observers,
with the large numbers of trials at their disposal, was to "let the sound
<em>announce</em> the letter" on the first trial, and then to "lie in wait for
the letter" so announced, and to "see whether it was too late or too
early." It was found to be too late usually, for this was the second
method of Angell and Pierce, which gave positive displacements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span></p>

<p>So at the next trial the preceding letter would be waited for, and
tested in the same way. The first trial was thus auditory-visual attention
and the second was visual-auditory, and there was a striving
after a balance where neither auditory nor visual impression had the
preference.</p>

<p>As soon as adjustment to the conditions of a given combination
had been secured, it was a simple matter to anticipate, with a fair
degree of accuracy, both a given letter and the recurrence of the
sound. The attention could thus be pretty accurately divided between
the two, and a very small time-displacement was the result.
When I was acting as observer, a change of the auditory interval
<em>upset</em> the whole <em>plan</em> of procedure for a short time. I had to accustom
myself to the new rhythm. But as soon as this adjustment
was made, it was just as easy to make the judgment at one rate as at
another, barring variations which might be called fortuitous, since
they were so small. This experience with the conditions here under
consideration, as well as the introspections of the other observers,
convinces me that the conception of an apperception-ripening time
has been overworked.</p>

<p>It is true that I find here, just as Pflaum<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> found, displacements
in both directions with every observer. It seems very doubtful to me,
however, whether these are in any sense due to what may be considered
a fixed apperception-time for a given observer, under fixed
objective conditions. The facility with which adaptation is made
to the changed conditions of a new combination of intervals, so that
just as small displacements are made under one as another, indicates
to my mind that one can control the conditions so that the
apperception shall ripen quickly or slowly, depending upon the
warmth of the interest, and the concentration or division of the attention,&mdash;that
there is a capacity in the ordinary individual so to
adapt himself to the conditions as to do equally good work in coÃ¶rdinating
two sense-impressions anywhere within a wide range of
intervals. The influence of the length of the interval separating succeeding
clicks, in determining displacements, has been considerably
overestimated. I should state here that no one of the three observers
had any specific training to reduce the displacement. The results
were not discussed with them. They had no means of knowing
what displacements they were making. This certainly adds strength
to the inference, from these results, that there are adaptable apperceptive
conditions for coÃ¶rdinating sense-impressions.</p>

<p>The next step in the analysis of the complication experiment,
bringing it into relation with the simple coÃ¶rdination of two disparate
stimuli, is to show, if possible, the influence of the <em>series</em> of <em>visual</em>
impressions. This naturally divides into two lines, namely, (1) the
<em>length</em> of the series as such, and (2) the relative influence, in case of
a given kind of displacement, of the part of the series coming <em>after</em>
the auditory stimulus, and the part <em>preceding</em> it. For the first, I used
in comparison, a series of twelve letters, a series of three, and a single
letter. For the second, the letter, whose coÃ¶rdination with the click
was set as the task of the observer, was made successively the first,
the last, and the middle member of a series of five letters.</p>

<p>During each hour of experimentation, the observer was tested as
to his accuracy of localization of the click, (1) in a series of twelve
letters at intervals of .083 sec., (2) in a series of three at the same
interval, and (3) with reference to a single letter. The method for
the first two was exactly as in the preceding experiments. In the
case of the single letter, he was asked to localize as accurately as
possible in terms of the intervals as he remembered them from the
series. This introduced an element of uncertainty. One observer,
St, would not give any judgments as to time-differences in the case
of the single letter. Another method had to be adopted in order to
obtain more comparable results. These results (Table III) are presented
as showing, by comparison with the following table, the transition
from one method to the other. Clicks were at 2-sec. intervals.
Each number in the table is the average result of fifty or more experiments.
They are in thousandths of seconds, and the plus and
minus signs indicate positive and negative displacements.</p>

<p>The method of right and wrong cases was used in the next group
of experiments, to secure the same conditions of making the judgment
in each of the three cases used above. Selecting a letter near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
the middle of each series, I asked the observer, in each of these cases,
just as in that of the single letter, to say whether the click was before,
on, or after the letter. I worked <em>out</em>, in successive experiments
by successive adjustments, from the position of apparent simultaneity
of click and letter, in both directions, to a point where in 75%
of the cases the click seemed to come before; and also to one where
it seemed to come after, in 75% of the cases. So also I worked <em>in</em>
both ways, by successive adjustments, from regions of clear discrimination
of time-difference and direction, to points where the time-relation
was uncertain or wrong in 75% of the trials. By averaging
the just perceptible and the just not perceptible, in each case, the
thresholds were obtained for "click first" and "click last." The
time between these thresholds I call the "range." It is really a measure
of James's "specious present" and of Stern's "PrÃ¤senzzeit."
(An admirable presentation of similar results by Wilhelm Peters<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>
has appeared since this work was done.) The best means of comparing
these results, for our present purposes, and also of bringing
them into relation with the complication-results already obtained,
is to take the mean point between these thresholds, and state its
position, in time, relative to the time of the visual stimulus (letter)
just before or after which the click came. This mean point is called
the "Threshold Mean" in the following tables. In Table IV, for example,
"After Letter .026 sec." means that the mean point between
the thresholds, "click first" and "click last" falls twenty-six sigmas
after the time of the exposure of the letter. These results are readily
comparable with those of Peters. By dividing the "range" by two,
and adding the "threshold mean" to one half, and subtracting it
from the other, one has the total interval between "click first" and
"click last" and its place with reference to the time of the visual
stimulus.</p>

<p>It must be distinctly understood that these "threshold means"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
are not displacements, and that the two cannot be compared as if
they were statements of the same facts. These <em>means</em> indicate the
centre of gravity of the "click first" "click last" interval with respect
to the visual stimulus. Changes in this centre of gravity may
reasonably be expected to approximate a variation <em>inverse</em> to that
of the displacements of the auditory stimulus. For example, any
change in the conditions which would tend to increase a <em>negative</em>
displacement would tend also to put the centre of gravity of the
"click first" "click last" interval <em>after</em> the visual stimulus, or, if
it were already after, to increase its time after. So also the <em>positive</em>
displacement and the position of the threshold mean <em>before</em> the visual
stimulus may be considered similar indications. For a click given
at the time of the threshold mean of a given observer, in connection
with the same visual stimulus, would certainly be judged by that
observer as simultaneous with the visual stimulus. If, then, this mean
is before the visual stimulus, the sound will be displaced positively,
<em>i. e.</em>, coÃ¶rdinated with a visual stimulus coming later. If the mean
is after the visual stimulus, the sound will be displaced negatively,
<em>i. e.</em>, coÃ¶rdinated with a visual stimulus coming earlier. The position
of the mean of the thresholds indicates a tendency toward the displacement
of the auditory impression in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>In Table III, three out of five observers, A, Sh, and Bo, show a
change from a negative displacement in the series of three to a positive
displacement in the series of twelve. If this were the effect of
the series, the same should show in the series of three as compared
with the single letter. Such a change is manifest in the results of
Bo. It is, however, very slight. The others increase the negative
displacement from the single letter to three letters. In Table IV,
of the same three observers represented, Sh changes the threshold
mean from <em>after</em> in the three-letter series to <em>before</em> in the twelve-letter
series, and A changes from <em>after</em> in one letter to <em>on</em> in three letters.
These changes correspond to changes from negative to positive
displacements for increase of series and introduction of series. G
shows the same change from one letter to three, in both tables.
These changes, in 55% of the cases offered for comparison in the
two tables, indicate a <em>decrease</em> of <em>negative displacement</em> and an <em>introduction</em>
of <em>positive displacement</em> as the <em>effect</em> of the <em>visual series</em>.
The visual element is made more focal in expectant attention as it
is more isolated, and so the tendency toward negative displacement
and increasing negative displacement as the serial character of the
visual impressions is stripped off. But there are strong counteractive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
tendencies, which control the 45% of comparisons not mentioned
above, where the increasing series shows increasing negative
displacement.</p>

<p>In the series all the observers adopted the method which has been
outlined above, that of letting the click pick out the letter, or letting
the letter announce itself. One said "the letter hits the sound."
After this sorting-out of the letter, they resorted to the system of
tests and counter-tests, in succeeding trials, to correct the first impression.
One can readily understand, then, that when they were
taken off the series altogether, an entirely different kind of adjustment
had to be made. G did not succeed in making this new adjustment
very well, as is shown by his exceptionally large range under
one letter. He could not get the two impressions to come together.
In attending to either one, he could not get the other in relation to
it. There was something in the visual series which enabled him to
get the visual impression in line with the auditory, and when this
was absent the same kind of work could not be done.</p>

<p>St had also a peculiar method, which was directly dependent
upon the serial character of the visual stimuli and impressions. He
allowed the series of clicks and the series of visual impressions to
establish themselves as a complex rhythm. Each series was rhythmic
independently. The two got connection by means of the click appearing
as an "after-strike," as on the piano, to a member of the visual
series. The letter "flashes out" for him as that of which the click
was the "after-strike." The click was thus between two letters. But
there was no amount of before or after about it. It was a general
quality of the whole complex which was taken to mean such and
such a position of click in the series. What he thus translated into
temporal judgments, were qualitative aspects of the rhythmic experience,
to which he usually attached no temporal meaning whatever.
Learning how so to translate them into temporal terms was
a definite process of training for him. Under these circumstances, he
of course had an entirely new lesson to learn when the visual series
was taken away. In fact, it might be, he would now find no visual
impression to which the click could be an after-strike, and so he
would be entirely without material to translate into temporal terms.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances it is not surprising to find G and St
exceptions to the majority of the observers in this experiment. This
makes more probable the effect of the series, inferred above for
the other observers,&mdash;namely, series decreases negative displacement.</p>

<p>It was noticed in the series of the three letters, particularly, that
some observers were much more accurate in their work when the
click was near one end of the series. In this experimental group,
the comparison is between cases where the click is coÃ¶rdinated with
(1) the first member of a visual series of five, (2) the middle member
of a series of five, and (3) the last of such a series. The method was
the same as that used in obtaining the results of Table IV. H was
the letter used in each case for coÃ¶rdination. Results follow in
Table V.</p>

<p>Under these conditions, whatever the effect of the visual series,
if it has any effect, opposite tendencies in direction of displacement
ought to be shown in the "H last" from those in the "H first,"
results, as each is contrasted with "H middle." Contrasted in this way,
these results, for A and St, show a relative approach of the mean to
zero for "H first," and a relative departure from zero for "H last,"
or a <em>decrease of a negative displacement for "H first"</em> and an <em>increase
of the same for "H last."</em> In other words, the series draws the displacement
of the click toward itself. A <em>negative displacement is increased
by a series coming before the visual stimulus</em> in question, and
<em>decreased by such a series coming after</em>. For R and Sh, the negative
displacement is increased in both H first and H last as compared
with H middle, but relatively the most for H last in both observers.
For G there is the same positive displacement introduced by both
H first and H last, but it is less than in any of the other cases. The
drift of the evidence here, then, is that the <em>visual series draws the displacement
in its own direction</em>. Each observer who has a negative
displacement (Threshold mean after) with "H middle" increases this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
when the series all comes before (H last) and two decrease it when
the series comes after (H first).</p>

<p>It is very evident to any one who has worked at all in the complication
experiment, that rhythm plays an important part in the
displacement. Witness also the astronomers' experience cited above,
St's waiting for the rhythm to establish itself, and my own readjustment
to the new conditions when a new combination of intervals
was given in the experiment with varying auditory intervals. In
order to show the part played by rhythm, I tested each one of five
observers on several different days, to fix for each of them both the
"click first" and the "click last" thresholds, as above, under each
of the following conditions: (1) one visual (single letter) and one
auditory stimulus (one pair), (2) one visual (single letter) and many
auditory stimuli, and (3) many visual (single letter repeated) and
many auditory stimuli (many pairs). For visual fixation, the observer
had a very dim light at the end of the observation-tube. The visual
stimulus was a flash of red in the place thus fixated. It had a total
duration of less than .005 sec. The surface exposed subtended a
vertical visual angle of about seven tenths of a degree. In the case
of one visual and many auditory stimuli, the visual stimulus was
given when the observer had heard the recurring auditory stimuli
several times and had himself given the "ready" signal. The results
follow in Table VI.</p>

<p>In this experiment, the observers A, H, and Hy, show an increasing
distance of the threshold mean after the visual stimulus, with the
successive introductions of the auditory series and the combined
series. In other words, the second column negative displacement is
larger than that of the first, and the third column has a still larger. G<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
and St are again exceptions, as they would be expected to be from the
above analysis of their methods. Each did his most accurate work in
a case where there was some rhythm present. St said in regard to this
work "the one pair abolishes the sound as a standard." The rhythmic
factor most missed by these observers, in the case of the single pair,
was the sound; for their results are almost the same in the second and
third columns. Introduction of the repetition of the visual series does
not make any decided difference. A, H, and Hy were able so to adjust
their attention as to get the best results in the case of the single
pair. The rhythm seemed to introduce for them a subjective rhythm
which upset the nice adjustment of attention and so increased the
displacement or the time between the threshold mean and the visual
stimulus. The negative displacement was increased under these
circumstances, probably as a result of the facilitation of the auditory
perceptive process. It has an <em>opened path</em>. It is a case of pre-perception.
Even when both were repeated (many pairs) the auditory
dominated, and so did the most at opening its path. But it seems
more likely to me that the rhythm, as such, whether auditory or auditory
and visual, claimed the attention and so proved a distraction
from the work of accurately discriminating the times of the impressions.
And this exaggerated the displacement or lack of discrimination
in whichever direction it was tending before.</p>

<p>In the successive stages of the investigation thus far, the complication
experiment has been stripped down by degrees to the simple
problem of the shortest possible interval between two disparate stimuli,&mdash;in
this case shortest auditory-visual and visual-auditory intervals,
as in the one-letter experiment of Table IV and the one-pair experiment
of Table VI. The various factors in the complication experiment
which have been successively analyzed out&mdash;the interval between
members of the auditory series, the length of the visual series, the
position of the visual series in relation to the auditory stimulus, and
the auditory series itself&mdash;have all been shown to be factors intimately
connected with the way the observer attends to the stimuli
in question. From the present standpoint, it may be said they are
all factors which, being introduced into the simple interval discrimination
experiment, modify the resulting judgment with regard to
the interval, by an interference with the normal attention-processes
in the discrimination of intervals.</p>

<p class="p2b">I<span class="smcapa">NTERVAL</span> D<span class="smcapa">ISCRIMINATION</span></p>

<p>The method of interval discrimination deserves special consideration.
Some of the introspective observations made by observers
while engaged in the work, already reported, are instructive in this
connection. In the case of a single pair, one observer said, "I know
which is first because it gets hit first." This remark is a very apt
expression of my own experience in trying to answer the same question.
"Getting hit first" clearly means, to my mind, some kind of
<em>action</em> on the part of the observer. He was ready, in the moment
of preparation for the experiment, to see a flash of red with his right
eye (either eye could have been used) and to hear a click with his left
ear. (The stimuli were each produced 25 cm. from the respective
sense-organs.) His preparation consisted in securing the "hair-trigger"
condition in the two parts of the cortex and conduction
apparatus immediately in question in the sensing of the two expected
stimuli, and other parts are in a shut-off-from-discharge condition.
This is the interpretation which seems to me an appropriate explanation
of the feeling of special readiness to discharge in these two
directions, when the expected stimuli shall come. The eye- and ear-muscles,
in such case, are held tense on the sides (in the organs)
where the stimuli are expected. The breath is held, and the whole
trunk is under a strain. All bodily processes, in so far as they are
controlled, are directed in such wise as to get whichever of these
expected impressions shall come first, in as short time as possible,
in order to know that it is first.</p>

<p>The reaction which gives the basis for the judgment may be a
conscious "hitting" of the first. Or it may be a reaction, ostensibly
as a part of the whole apperceptive process of which the auditory
and visual processes are parts. This reaction may be any one of
many kinds. Often it is a letting-go of the held breath. The exhalation
or other reaction comes in response to the whole stimulating or
"setting-off" process, and the one or the other of the two stimuli is
judged to be first by certain peculiar relations within the experience
of the moment. Such an explanation is in part suggested by the
expression of St, that the visual impression when it came before
the auditory, appeared as a "grace-note," and when it came after the
auditory, as an "after-strike." St played the piano. He himself
thought that this discrimination was a motor affair, <em>i. e.</em>, a difference
judged on the basis of a difference in the motor response. The
judgment of the temporal order of the two impressions seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
to be an interpretation or translation of the different motor responses.</p>

<p>A, whose method brought the shortest range in Tables IV, V, and
VI, said, "I hold my breath at the moment of expected stimulation,
and it goes at the first impression." At another time he said, "When
I say 'click first' I have the feeling that the click is left, and when
I say 'click last,' that the click is on the right." He interpreted this
to mean that when the click sounded first, he had moved slightly toward
it, that is, to the left, and that when the visual stimulus had
come first, he had moved slightly toward it (it was sensed by his
left eye), and this was rather away from the sound, which would have
come before the movement could have been more than initiated.</p>

<p>In my own case, I felt distinctly different motor responses in the
two cases. There was an immediate feeling of release in whichever
organ the stimulus first reached. A little involuntary jerk occurred
in the musculature of this sense-organ, and sometimes the head
moved slightly in the direction of the first stimulus. The condition
of the next moment from which the judgment proceeded seemed to
be best expressed thus, "I had it at a time when the other was not
there." The attention was accurately set for both. Right eye and
left ear were both distinctly innervated. The first stimulus "struck"
the appropriate organ, and the "set" of the organ was released.</p>

<p>I am persuaded that the difference in sensitivity to intervals between
auditory and visual impressions is due, in part, to a difference
in the power of "cocking the ear" to hear, as one fixates the eye
to see. The observers who got the smallest ranges between upper
and lower thresholds had the most distinct kinÃ¦sthetic sensations
in the moment of preparation, in the middle ear and about the external
meatus. All had some sensations from the side of the head
in question. The less accurate had a general feeling in the neck-muscles.
Accuracy of discrimination was in no wise connected with
voluntary control of the musculature moving the pinna. This was
subject of careful enquiry with all observers.</p>

<p>If this introspective evidence leads me aright, it seems that the
non-discriminable interval between auditory and visual impressions
is due principally to two things, (1) the impossibility of perfect balance
in the preparation of the attention for two expected stimuli,
and (2) the possible difference in time it takes to react to the different
impressions. The various complicating conditions which are
added to the simple interval discrimination in the cases of a complication
experiment, such as we started with in this investigation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
are chiefly interferences with the first-named factor. They disturb
the nice balances of attention. In this simple discrimination experiment,
under favorable conditions, a close approximation to a balance
can be attained. Any difference in the reaction-times to different
stimuli will remain as a constant error of displacement. It is well
known that reaction-times to visual stimuli are longer than those to
auditory. There is a retinal inertia which delays the perception of
the visual impression, in comparison with the auditory, coming from
exactly simultaneous stimuli. Having this physiological basis, it
will be relatively constant, as compared with the ever-varying attention-differences.</p>

<p>Having given, then, these relatively fixed temperamental conditions
of reactions to different stimuli, which remain after practice (training
in the control of attention) has reduced the reactions to their lowest
terms, and has secured the conditions which are favorable for the
best balancing of the attention, there is yet one other question very
germane to the subject. It will have occurred already to any one reading
the above, that while the response to one stimulus is being made,
the other may be held in abeyance in the fringe region of the attention-field,
and that it is only brought up to clear perception when
the first has been disposed of. In other words, it may well be that
the first of two simultaneous but disparate stimuli, which gets a
start at setting-off its appropriate response in its sense-organ, will
bring out this response and be perceived before the other one gets
started,&mdash;that we do only one thing at a time,&mdash;that even in such
minute processes as this there is no possibility of division of attention.
It is hardly probable on the basis of the experimentation already
reported, that this is the case. There is some division of attention.
Otherwise there would be an equal certainty of judgment in
every case, no matter how small the separating interval. But still
the question as to how two mental processes, starting at the same
moment of time, do proceed, as compared to the progress of each of
the same processes when it holds the field alone, is very vital to the
understanding of the psychology of interval-discrimination. And thus
the question of objective time-relations is necessarily involved in that
of making judgments of the time-relations of simple mental processes
(subjective time-relations). The question is, Do these processes,
starting simultaneously, proceed just as freely as if they were the
sole occupants of the field of attention and so had the whole energy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
of attention concentrated upon the single process, or do they <em>interfere</em>
with each other?</p>

<p>Distribution of attention, of some sort, is granted. It is generally
conceded that there must be some sort of overlapping of the processes
in any complex mental operation. But there is the greatest
lack of information as to how this overlapping takes place,&mdash;as
to the mechanism of the distribution of attention. Fechner held to
the notion of a fixed maximum of available psychophysical energy.
If this energy is being consumed in a single process, that process is
very vivid, and all other processes are below the threshold. If, on
the other hand, it is distributed over several simultaneous processes,
they are all of diminished vividness. Distribution of attention always
means diminution of vividness, and concentration of attention, increase
of vividness. (See Elemente der Psychophysik, vol. 2, p.
451, 1860.) There is no question of the truth of the last statement,
and very likely Fechner's fundamental concept is a true one; but
there is need of more definite data on the conditions and nature of
simple mental processes occurring at the same time, before it is
considered proved.</p>

<p>Such researches as those of Paulhan,<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> Jastrow,<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> Loeb,<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> and De
Sanctis<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> all dealt with the combination of processes which were themselves
quite complex. It may well be that such processes as reciting
a poem, performing a subtraction or multiplication of long numbers
on paper, or keeping time with a metronome with the hand, seem
to go along together when combined, so that the time taken to do
the two of them together is much less than the sum of the times
required for their separate performance, and, in some cases, no
greater than the time required for either alone, and yet there may
be no real proceeding together. The apparent saving of time may
be due, as Paulhan suggested, to a rapid oscillation from one to the
other of the two complex processes which are largely automatic and
can proceed, to such extent as they are automatic, without any attention.
This illustrates how these investigations have probably missed
the real point at issue with regard to the division and distribution of
attention. The attention might be distributed over several of the
minuter part-processes of these processes so that many were proceeding
at the same time, and yet the method of these experiments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
would not reveal it. They were not planned with sufficient precision.
There is a problem in the division of attention which they did not
come within sight of, and this is the real question of division in case
of the simplest processes.</p>

<p>This problem is really that of the mechanism of mental assimilation.
The process it investigates is illustrated by the maturing
collective idea, as a melody or a spoken sentence. There is a gradual
enrichment or growth in meaning, as such a process goes on toward
its completion. At any instant during the process, implicit associative
and nascent perceptive elements are working together to their
own mutual clarification and explication. All focal content is the
result of complicated interworkings of such fringe material. It is
impossible, it seems to me, to question the causal relation of the
fringe elements or processes of one moment to the focal of the next;
and it is equally impossible to deny the complication of these same
fringe processes. They must go on at the same time in order to enter
into one and the same resultant process. The question of direct
interest at this point in the discussion is, To what extent do they
proceed at the same time?</p>

<p>It would seem from the way in which this question, of the relationship
and interference of mental processes which proceed or start
to proceed at the same time, has come up in this investigation, that
the natural method of pursuing it would be that of comparing reaction
times for cognition reactions to the single and combined
stimuli. But we are warned against this by very clear inferences
from an investigation of Professor MÃ¼nsterberg's in which he used
the reaction method.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> By an ingenious use of the reaction experiment,
the author shows that two-part processes in a reaction, as,
for example, a restricted judgment of class and a subjective preference,
occupy about the same time when combined in a single reaction
as when either is performed in a separate reaction. In other
words, two judgments of distinctly different kinds can be made in
the same time as either can be made when it has all the attention
concentrated upon it. The conclusion that these elementary processes
go on together&mdash;that at least there is some degree of overlapping&mdash;seems
unavoidable.</p>

<p>But when the first part of the same report is considered in relation
to the second, it is clearly shown that the reaction experiment is not
adapted to the finer investigation of this problem. For the first part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
shows that no matter how much a <em>motor</em> reaction is complicated by
choices or other judgments, it always takes place in just about the
same time as the simple reaction. The complications may be such
as actually to double the reaction time in the case of a sensory reaction,
and yet a motor reaction, under precisely the same conditions
as far as they may be the same for a motor, shows no increase in time.
The "set" of the attention in the motor reaction is, no doubt, such
a change in the order of succession of the parts of the process that
some of those, which come after the stimulus is received in the case
of the sensory reaction, are made to come before the stimulus in the
motor. When, however, it is found that the motor response to the
question, "Is this the name of a scientist, philosopher, poet, statesman,
or musician,&mdash;Sappho?" is made by the appropriate finger,
as previously agreed upon, in just as short a time as the observer
can make a motor response with any finger to a simple auditory
stimulus, it indicates, either that the whole of the choice judgment
has been made before the stimulus was received, or that the judgment
itself is so automatic that it is practically a reflex. This latter
cannot be true. The judgment, as conscious choice, cannot be made
before the stimulus is given, <em>i. e.</em>, until the question is completed.
And judgment cannot be made automatic and yet be a judgment.
In fact both alternatives are untenable, and there is no other course
than to hold the situation which gave rise to them at fault. If the
judgment process here required previous to the reaction does take
time apart from the processes of the simple reaction, the reaction
process is shown by these experiments to be unable to exhibit it.
A more microscopic method is demanded before the matter can be
settled.</p>

<p>The Leipsic method of measuring the scope of attention by means
of the tachistoscope is the standard means of securing data as to
the <em>number</em> of elementary processes which can go on at the same
time in consciousness. The same question, with which we are here
concerned, grows directly out of the investigation of the number
of processes which can go on together. Wundt acknowledges the
great difficulty which inheres in the investigation of this problem.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
Cattell's early work with the tachistoscope showing the numbers of
letters, syllables, and words, which could be apperceived under the
same objective conditions, indicated the great importance of what
we may best call <em>meaning</em>, in apperception, and its influence on the
number of different processes which may proceed together. In fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
the number depends upon the definition of the unit with which the
investigator starts out. Wirth, the latest emendator of the tachistoscopic
method, has shown,<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> in a very thoroughgoing and genuinely
constructive criticism of earlier work, that the one question of primary
importance in investigations of the content of the moment of
consciousness, <em>i. e.</em>, scope of attention, is to set forth the relative
clearnesses of the elementary processes there proceeding together.
He shows that the different grades of clearness which may present
themselves in the field of consciousness of a momentary act indicate,
on the one hand, the impossibility of sharply distinguishing the
"scope of attention" from the "scope of consciousness" as Wundt
uses these terms, and, on the other, the serious indefiniteness of any
merely numerical statement of the scope of attention. His main
purpose is to set forth a method by which this field can be enriched
by exhaustive statements of the relative clearnesses of the processes
going on at the same time. All the work of the present study had
been performed before the publication of Wirth's work. Otherwise
some of his suggestions would have been used in the plan of the
experiments following. I may say, however, that I believe the method
here used has its own distinctive merits.</p>


<p class="p2b">G<span class="smcapa">ENERAL</span> M<span class="smcapa">ETHOD</span> <span class="smcapa">FOR</span> T<span class="smcapa">ESTS</span> <span class="smcapa">IN</span> C<span class="smcapa">OEXISTENCE</span></p>

<p>Taking the suggestions offered by Professor MÃ¼nsterberg's study
of apperceptive and associative processes, I selected simple <em>judgments
of comparison</em> as the best means of trying-out this question
of coexistence. The perceptive act itself is made up of judgments,
and these may very properly be the processes studied in combination
as in the tachistoscopic experiment. But the judgment which
has a previous perceptive act as its condition, determining its start,
seems to be better under control. It is itself a central process, not
dependent upon the variations of the objective factors in sensation.
My plan was to have the stimuli so arranged as to give rise to two
or more perceived conditions at the same moment, and so have one
or more judgments of comparison between the perceived features
made at the moment the perceptions were completed and immediately
stated. If one makes two series of single judgments of comparison,
and a series wherein these two judgments are combined in
a single act, all three under precisely the same objective conditions,
and the same subjective conditions, saving only the necessary changes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
in the <em>direction</em> of the attention, and the percentage of correct judgments
is recorded in each case, providing always that in no single
series of judgments were the conditions such that all judgments
could be correctly given, he would then have reasonable grounds
for making inferences with respect to the <em>interference</em> of simple mental
processes going on at the same time,&mdash;whether there is any, and,
if there is, how much there is. <em>Interference</em> would be indicated by
the <em>falling-off in percentage of correct judgments as the combinations
were increased</em>.</p>

<p>Such relative accuracy of judgments, single and combined, was
the test sought after and relied upon in the following experiments.
It was very necessary to have the objective conditions such that the
results in cases of single judgments, later to be combined, should
be short of absolute correctness, in order that interference from the
combination should show itself in impaired accuracy. Otherwise
there might be some <em>free energy of attention</em>, which could readily
take up the extra work when the judgments were combined, and so
there would be no impairment of accuracy. It was the aim to have
the objective conditions, such as duration and extent, so regulated
that about ninety per cent correct judgments resulted in the series
of single judgments. If, then, when two were combined, eighty per
cent were given correctly, and when three were combined, seventy
per cent, the inference would seem reasonable that this falling-off
in correctness was due to interference. The failure of the perceptive
process, indicated by the ten per cent incorrect judgments in the
series of singles, would remain a <em>constant</em> source of error throughout.</p>

<p>There is, however, one other source of increasing error, with the
increasing combination of judgments, supposed above. The judgment
processes might go on at the same time without any impairment
of the accuracy of the single judgment, and yet the results, as
expressed, might show a falling-off in accuracy. This imperfection
would then be due to a partial failure of the retentive and reproductive
processes, and not to the imperfection of the judgment processes.
I have found no sure means of separating this factor and excluding
it. As the experiments were arranged and conducted, though, I believe
any impairment in accuracy resulting from combination is more
likely due to interference of the judgment processes.</p>

<p>If neither of these factors is efficient, on the other hand, there will
result no falling-off in accuracy of results when single judgments
are combined. To be sure the conditions of the experiment, as outlined
so far, do not preclude the possibility of the combined judgments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
occurring in succession, and so giving rise to as large a percentage
of correct results as when occurring singly. That is, while one
of the so-called combined judgments was in process, the latent conditions
of the other would remain for the moment as mere physiological
or possibly psychical dispositions, and to these one would
"hark back" in the next moment. Here the reaction method is suggested
as the means of assurance that this is not the case. But this
method, we have already seen, will not lend itself to work of such
precision as this. The probability of this succession of judgments
is reduced to a minimum in the experimental groups following.</p>

<p>It can be practically precluded by a prevention of all sensory images.
In these experiments every precaution was used to prevent
them. In all cases where visual stimuli were used, for instance, a
brightly illuminated blue field immediately succeeded the momentary
stimulus, while comparative darkness preceded it. I cannot be so
sure that there were no memory images functioning. But all observers
were carefully questioned on this point at frequent intervals
during the experiments, and no evidence of their existence was found
in any case. I feel sure sensory images were excluded and think
memory images very improbable.</p>

<p>In this group of experiments, I used judgments from visual and
tactual stimuli, singly and in combination. Both stimuli were given
by means of a large pendulum in the Harvard laboratory, specially
constructed for Professor MÃ¼nsterberg. This pendulum is about
one and a half metres in length. It is hung in a heavy steel frame
which rests upon a large table. A curved steel bar, concentric with
the swing of the pendulum, and ninety degrees in extent, is so set to
the frame that it serves as the attachment for an electro-magnet, at
any point in the swing of the pendulum. The pendulum-rod carries
an armature which fits this magnet. By means of this magnet, the
pendulum may be held at any point between the position of rest and
forty-five degrees out in either direction; and it may be released by
<em>breaking</em> the circuit through the magnet. The pendulum also carries
a segmental screen of about seventy degrees extent. An opening
about nine by eight centimetres near the centre of the screen affords
means of tachistoscopic observations. A sliding shutter makes the
slit as narrow as may be desired. In these experiments a black tube
was set up, at right angles to the direction of the motion of the pendulum,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
and at the height of the slit in the screen. On the other side
of the pendulum screen, and directly opposite the tube, was placed
a support for holding the object to be shown.</p>

<p>The object for the visual stimulus was one of two light gray lines
on a black background. These lines were 4 mm. wide, and one 44 mm.
long, and the other 40 mm. The work was done in a dark room.
The stimulus card was illuminated by an electric light hanging between
it and the screen. Both cards were shown the observer several
times, before experimenting, till he was sure of their lengths. Upon
one being shown, in experiment, he was asked to say whether it was
the longer or shorter. The touch apparatus was so arranged that
the experimenter could at will give the observer one or two contacts
on the back of his right hand. The contacts were made by means of
an electro-magnet. This was actuated by a current which was <em>made</em>
by the closing of a switch which was secured by a set-screw to the
same curved steel bar as bore the pendulum magnet. This switch
was closed by the pendulum in passing. It was adjustable on the
bar. Another similar switch, opened by the falling pendulum the
next instant, removed the tactual stimuli. These switches were so
placed in the course of the pendulum fall that the tactual and visual
stimuli were exactly simultaneous. The tactual judgments were,
<em>one</em> or <em>two</em> points touched. Results are presented in Table VII for
three observers, A, B, and Bo. The number of series which were
averaged in each case is given, in order properly to weight the
results.</p>

<p>In Table VIII are given A's results for further experimentation
under the same conditions, also for a pair of visual judgments, a
pair of tactual, and all four combined. One series of each of the five
was given each hour of experimentation. For the additional visual
judgment, the observer was required to say whether the line was
<em>high</em> or <em>low</em>. It was of two heights from the lower edge of the card,
17 mm. and 20 mm. For the other tactual judgment, he reported
the point or points touched on the hand, as on the <em>right</em> or <em>left</em> side.
The middle line was traced by the experimenter, before tests, as often
as the observer wished to be reassured of its position.</p>

<p>The next additional combination was a pair of judgments based
upon auditory stimuli. Four electric clickers were placed on the
wall behind the observer. Two were loud and two faint. Each pair
was accurately adjusted so they were of the same intensity and quality.
One of each pair, <em>i. e.</em>, one loud and one faint, were hung about
four feet to the left of the observer's median plane. The other two
were hung at an equal distance to the right of this plane. The circuit
making the click was <em>made</em> by a switch closed by the pendulum
as it fell. The experimenter by pressing any one of four buttons gave
the one of the clicks he desired. The observer's two judgments were
as to the <em>loudness</em> and the <em>position of the click</em>.</p>

<p>It is evident, on the face of these returns, that there is no positive
assurance of interference. Each of these observers had been in some
part of the complication work. And so the inference from lack of
evidence here can be carried back to that work, and we may rest
assured that the lack of accuracy in interval discrimination work
by these observers was due in minimal measure, if in any, to interference
of the mental processes, auditory and visual, tending to proceed
at the same time. Some parts of the results here presented look
like evidence for interference. But there is, on the whole, just as
much evidence of what one might call facilitation, in combination,
as there is of interference.</p>

<p>There is one source of possible explanation for the non-appearance
of evidence of interference in these results: that is the fact that
the stimuli are disparate, and so probably take different times for
maturing. Thus the judgment processes, so far as they thus start
from disparate sensations, may start at different times. There was
good reason for using disparate stimuli first for the combination of
two mental processes, as this was the closest related to the simple
interval discrimination experiment to which the complication experiment
had been reduced. But this objection is now easily overridden
by making the conditions of experiment such that all judgments
start from one and the same perceptual process.</p>


<p class="p2b">O<span class="smcapa">NE</span>, T<span class="smcapa">WO</span>, <span class="smcapa">AND</span> T<span class="smcapa">HREE</span> J<span class="smcapa">UDGMENTS</span> <span class="smcapa">BASED</span> <span class="smcapa">UPON</span> <span class="smcapa">A</span>
S<span class="smcapa">INGLE</span> S<span class="smcapa">ENSE</span>-P<span class="smcapa">ERCEPTION</span></p>

<p>The conditions here were such that the perceptual basis for any
one of the single judgments was at the same time the possible basis
for any other single judgment and also for any or all of them combined.
What judgment or judgments were given depended entirely
upon the directions given, and the consequent preparation of the
attention. Under these conditions, there could no longer be any doubt
about the even start of all judgments, so far as outer conditions were
concerned. The only remaining cause of an uneven finish&mdash;lagging
of a process, as shown by its increased inaccuracy when combined&mdash;must
be interference with its progress by other processes
going on at the same time.</p>

<p>Visual stimuli were used. The objects to give the perceptual basis
for the judgments were small rectangular openings in cardboard seen,
on exposure, by <em>transmitted</em> light. These rectangular windows in
the cardboard were 2 cm. by 1 cm. and stood in the vertical position
1 cm. apart. The judgments were all based upon differences existing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
between these rectangles as shown. One of these differences was
in <em>length</em>. They might be of the same length, or either the right or
left might be 2 mm. longer than the other. Another difference was
in <em>shade</em>. This was secured by different thicknesses of paper, pasted
over the openings. Two shades were used. The opening on one side
might be shown as either the same brightness, brighter, or less bright.
The third difference was in the <em>number of lines</em> which crossed the
rectangles. Two or three wires were placed across them horizontally
and about 5 mm. apart. Thus they had the same number of lines,
or one had fewer or more than the other.</p>

<p>The same large pendulum was used in these experiments. The
moveable magnet on the curved steel bar was kept in one position
throughout. It held the pendulum, ready for release, at twenty degrees
from the position of rest. The adjustable weight on the pendulum
was also kept in one position. The only adjustment which was
changed during this series of experiments was the width of the slit
in the window of the screen. This was varied from one millimetre
to five. The whole time during which any part of the two rectangles
was in view (the total exposure) with a 5 mm. slit was .033 sec.; with
a 3 mm. slit .031 sec.; with a 1 mm. slit .029 sec. These times were
measured with a Hipp's chronoscope. The entire visual field, embracing
the two rectangles, was about 2 cm. by 3 cm., and was about
three fourths of a metre from the observer's eye. It could be accurately
fixated beforehand and fully exploited during the moment of
exposure.</p>

<p>The observer was always instructed to give his judgments in terms
of one of the two rectangles. If, for example, length was in question,
he should say of the left-hand rectangle that it was longer,
shorter, or of the same length as the right-hand one. The process
of expressing the judgments was also facilitated by using the terms
plus, minus, and equal, for all three sorts of judgments. This was
a special aid to expression where two or more judgments were in
question at the same time. In these cases the observer was always
given an order beforehand, in which the judgments were to be given.
This order for the three combined, for example, was always, "length,
lines, shade," as in the following tables. If, then, the judgments were
given "plus, minus, minus," it meant that the left-hand rectangle
was longer, had fewer lines, and was less bright than the right. The
process of making these interpretations, as well as the order, was
made automatic with the observer, by practice, before experimenting.</p>

<p>Three observers, A, B, and Y, were used in this experiment. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
judgments were made in series of ten. Each hour's work was distributed
over (1) several series of single judgments, (2) two at a time,
and (3) three at a time, the aim being to get an equal number of judgments
of each kind, length, lines, and shade, under each of the
three conditions. The results are given as general percentages of
correct results. To properly weight these averages, the number of
series (of ten judgments each) which are included in making up any
average, is given just above the average.</p>

<p>Since these general averages for the single judgments are so close
to those in pairs, it seemed possible that the presence of objective differences,
other than the single one asked for, might be a distracting
agent, and really interfere with the judgment process in question.
For example, when judgment on length was in question, it might
be possible to give it correctly a larger number of times, if there were
no differences in shade or lines, than if these were present. Some
careful test experiments were made with a view to clearing up this
situation. The observers in no case knew the nature of the investigation,
nor were they aware that other differences were absent in
some of the cases. The results presented in Table XI certainly show
that the presence of other differences than the one in question is
no cause of interference.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the precautions taken to secure the full energy
of attention for the single judgment process, as already indicated in
the discussion preliminary to these experiments,&mdash;namely, by making
the stimulation conditions so near the threshold that only a part
of the judgments could be given correctly,&mdash;there still appeared a
probability that there was free energy of attention during the single
judgment process. The observers seemed to do more work when
more judgments were asked for. If this is true, the results of Table
X are not a true index of interference. If there is free energy during
the moment of making the single judgment, this may readily be used
for another process when combined with the first, and so there will
be no interference. This is a sufficient proof so far as it has immediate
bearing upon the interval discrimination experiment, but the
further question as to what will take place if we can use this free
energy, if it exists, in both processes alike, is an important one for
the question of the relation of two processes going on together in
consciousness.</p>

<p>To ascertain the fact in this matter, I performed a series of experiments
with the same observers, in which previous occupation
of the mind served as a distraction. The distraction consisted in a
simple arithmetical operation,&mdash;addition or subtraction. The moment
before giving the stimulus for the judgment processes,&mdash;in
the place of the "ready" signal, I would call out some numbers, as,
for example, "twenty-four from sixty-three" or "fifty-seven and
fifteen," the first indicating subtraction and the second addition.
The answer to the addition or subtraction was always given before
the judgment or judgments, to make sure that it was performed.
And in any case where the observer knew that the addition or subtraction
was done before he attended to the stimulus for the judgment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
that particular test was thrown out. The results are given in
the same form as in Table X.</p>

<p>These results (general average percentages) show, for observer
A, a more regular and somewhat larger falling-off with combination
than in Table X, for B and for Y, a diminished falling-off, and relatively
less for the three than for the two combined judgments. The
percentages are lower throughout. This is a result to be expected.
But there is no notable change in the relative lowering of two judgments
in comparison with single judgments, or of three in comparison
with two, such as should appear if, as supposed, in the experiment
resulting in Table X, there had been free energy of attention in the
case of the single judgment.</p>

<p>It was my aim in these experiments, with distraction through another
simultaneous process, to secure a uniform residue of attention
for the judgment processes, whether single, in twos, or in threes.
The arithmetical operations were therefore as uniform as possible.
But it may readily be that very unequal demands were made upon
a given observer by successive operations, one's automatisations in
number-work may be so various. These would no doubt tend to
average up in the course of the whole work running through several
weeks. But in order to make more sure of the point, I tried another
means of using the free energy of attention which may exist in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
case of the single judgment, namely, by suggesting a judgment or
series of judgments just before an exposure. It will be recalled that
the order of judgments was always the same as that of the tables,
and that all were expressed as minus, plus, or equal. So if the experimenter
called out before a three-judgment exposure, "plus,
equal, minus," it would be in the nature of a challenge to the observer
to assure himself beyond a doubt whether or not the exposure
showed the left-hand rectangle as longer than the right, having the
same number of lines, and being less bright. The so-called suggestion
was a distinct factor in heightening attention. This is shown
especially in Y's case by the larger percentage of correct judgments.
Results are averaged in Table XIII.</p>

<p>The effect of the so-called suggestions in making for correct judgments
was then quite noticeable in the case of single judgments, less
so in two judgments, and none whatever in three. This observer was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
able to overcome 73% to 80% of the wrong so-called suggestions.
Now, when it is considered that only 80% to 82% of all the judgments
given by B (see Table XIII) are correct, it is very clear that
their action as suggestions was very slight. They had an influence,
however. It was shown, as expected, in a heightened attention.
This was especially the case with Y. Compare his general averages
in Table XIII with those in Table X. This rise in general averages
coincides with the impression of the experimenter during the experiment.
It seemed then that this was a distinct challenge to keen
attention on the part of Y. He is a man who intends to make impartial
observations for himself, and has no notion of being told
what he is to see. That his general averages of correct judgments
stand so much farther apart in this case with heightened attention
than in either of the others (see Tables X and XII) is indicative
of an interference of the judgment processes themselves.</p>

<p>Such a series of general averages as those of Y in Table XIII, as
those of B in Table X, or as those of A in Table XII, seem, in themselves,
and under the conditions of the experiment, to be pretty
clear indication of an interference of simple mental processes carried
on at the same time. The only other explanation is that suggested
above, namely, an interference of the processes of reproduction
and expression. The conditions of the experiment seem to
reduce the probability of this to a minimum. But the centre of interest,
in considering the results, does not lie in the question as to whether
it is interference of the judgment processes themselves or the processes
of their reproduction. The foreground is occupied by a prior
question, namely, whether there is any evidence here presented for
interference. For if there is interference of such processes, why does
it not show up in the results for each of the observers in each of the
Tables X, XII, and XIII? Of the nine cases here offered for comparison,
only the three above designated show what may be called
clear evidence of progressively increasing interference with increase
of combined processes proceeding at the same time.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances this cannot be accepted as indisputable
evidence of interference. Such results as those of A in Table X,
where correct judgments, two at the same time, are given in 88%
of the cases, and three at the same time, in 91% of the cases, stand
directly opposed to interference. They seem to show a facilitation
by combination. This is indeed possible where three and only three
sorts of judgment are worked with. It is the limiting case, and if
more than one is asked for it is really easier to give three than to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
select two. A himself remarked that this was the case. A similar
explanation holds concerning the results of B in Table XII, and
those of A in Table XIII. If such an explanation is the true one, it
is manifest that the "limit of attention," of which mention has been
made above, has probably not been reached in any of these cases.
On the whole, these experiments <em>seem to indicate a small degree of
interference of simple mental processes going on at the same time</em>. But
such interference <em>cannot be considered proved</em> by these experiments.</p>


<p class="p2b">T<span class="smcapa">HE</span> Q<span class="smcapa">UESTION</span> <span class="smcapa">OF</span> S<span class="smcapa">YNERGY</span></p>

<p>In connection with these last experiments, where the comparative
judgments all proceed from one definite perceptive act, and where
therefore the conditions are most accurately controlled for showing
the effect of interference, if it is a fact, there is yet another means
of looking into that question. This is afforded by the <em>similarity</em> of
the <em>means of expressing</em> the different kinds of judgment. In connection
with the current emphasis given to the motor side of mental
processes, it is often urged that mental processes go on at the same
time when they are working together toward one and the same motor
out-go. Otherwise they are likely, at least, to hinder each other,
and to take their turns. If such is the case, the similarity of motor
out-go which is present in these cases, where all three judgments
are plus, or all minus, or all equal, ought to produce a larger percentage
of correct judgments than is found in cases where there are
two or three kinds of expression. Furthermore, if there is no interference
of the judgment processes as such, but, as supposed possible
above, the impaired accuracy of judgment in the combination of
judgments is due to the imperfection of the memory, this too will
be diminished by similarity of expression of the three judgments.
In fact similarity should reduce this source of error to a minimum.
The results presented in Tables X, XII, and XIII, for three combined
judgments, were worked over, so far as possible, and all cases
where the three judgments, if correctly made, would have been expressed
similarly, were separated out. The total number of such
cases, and all those where the judgments would have been properly
expressed dissimilarly, are recorded for each observer in Table XV.
The number actually given correctly under each class is also recorded,
as well as the <em>percentage</em> of correct judgments in each class
for each observer.</p>

<p>If the results of B and Y were presented alone, they would seem
to indicate synergy of similarly expressed judgments. But those
of A are most strongly contradictory of such a working together of
such judgments. This is very surprising to me, as A had such a
facility in expressing these similar judgments, especially "equal,
equal, equal," that it suggested this comparison. But the apparent
facile expression is here shown to have attended a diminished accuracy.
No conclusion can be drawn with respect to synergic influence
from the similarity of expression of judgments.</p>

<p>Reviewing this work in combination of judgments with reference
to its bearing upon the complication results, and the interval discrimination
results, it seems that interference of simple mental processes
going on at the same time, though it appears to be a fact,
showing itself in impaired accuracy of processes combined, is yet
quite inadequate to explain the whole, or indeed, any considerable
part of the synchronism, as we may call the "click first" "click
last" interval of Tables IV, V, and VI. The slight amount of interference
of such processes as the auditory and visual perceptions,
tending to proceed at the same time, would tend to a very slight
displacement of one with regard to the other. It is true, for reasons
already discussed, that this time-difference is so slight and so difficult
of seizure that it cannot be measured, and so no measure is
offered. We cannot, therefore, be certain <em>how much</em> of the non-detectable
interval is due to this cause. But the evidence offered in the
above tables of results is ample justification for the statement that
<em>interference</em> can be responsible for only a <em>very small part</em> of the "click
first" "click last" interval.</p>

<p>In the case of this interval, as in that of an interval between any
disparate stimuli, a part of it must be due to the different resistance
or inertia of the sense-organs. The eye is undoubtedly slower than
the ear. This would at once suggest itself as the cause of the interval
between the threshold mean and the visual stimulus in the results<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
shown in Tables IV, V, and VI above. That is, vision being slower,
an auditory stimulus given at the same time as a visual will appear
to be earlier, and it may be given considerably later and yet appear
earlier. In general, therefore, so far as this cause is active, one would
expect that the interval, at which a sound must precede a visual
stimulus in order to be certainly distinguished as coming before the
latter, would be much shorter than the interval, at which a sound
coming after a visual stimulus could be unfailingly distinguished
as coming later. In other words, the centre of gravity of the "click
first" "click last" interval, so far as this visual inertia is the cause
of its displacement with reference to the visual stimulus time, will
be <em>after</em> the visual stimulus.</p>

<p>In one case in my results, Table V, St, H middle, there is presented
an extreme where not only the centre of gravity (threshold
mean) is placed after the visual stimulus (letter), but the whole synchronous
period ("click first" "click last" interval) is after the
visual stimulus, so that a sound coming .008 sec. after the visual
stimulus is distinguished with certainty as coming before it. So also
St, in Table VI, one pair, the sound coming .006 sec. after is judged
as coming before the visual stimulus.</p>

<p>But the variety of displacements of the threshold mean in different
observers, and more particularly in the same observer under different
experimental conditions, indicates very clearly that there are
factors other than visual inertia which are quite as important, and
perhaps equally responsible for this displacement. In Table VI, H,
one pair, for example, the threshold mean is before the visual stimulus
.011 sec. So in Table V, G, H first, and also H last, it is before
the letter .005 sec. In these cases there must be some factor or factors
quite as strong as this visual inertia, and counteractive to it.
These are, in part, the complex attention factors which have been
referred to already. Prominent among them are the rhythmic perception
which is so marked in St; the movement toward the first stimulus
and the "letting-go" of the breath, of A; the passive "striking"
of the letter by the sound, in the case of some of the observers; and
the "cocking" of the eye and the ear, of others. These all have to
do with the length and place of the "click first" "click last" interval
quite as much as does the visual inertia. But however this may be,
of this inertia and the other factors just now named, probably each
has more to do with it than does the interference of the perception
processes themselves.</p>

<p>But after eliminating the parts played by each and all of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
agencies in the determination of the interval, there will remain a
period of "present time," in which there are no time-differences,
and no qualitative differences which lead the subject to suspect the
existence of time-differences. The mental content of this reduced
synchronous period in experience is <em>one experience</em>. The sound was
heard and the letter was seen, but they came <em>together</em> as aspects of
<em>one</em> experience. In the moment of perceiving either one, it was not
possible to say that the other was already a memory. In other words,
the <em>primary memory</em> of either, whichever came first, had lasted over
into the perception of the second. There had been no perceivable
transformation of the first since the instant of its perception. At the
moment of the inception of the second process, the first was still,
to the perceiving subject, what it was at the moment of its own inception.
Though change was probably going on in the physiological
substrata of the mental process in question, in every minutest moment
of the interval, yet a certain amount of effect of this change
had to accumulate before the observer could become aware of the
change, and so be aware of the passing of time or of temporal difference.
This was, then, only a case of the working of the law of
<em>relativity</em>. And the perception of time is a function of the duration
and amount of change of mental process.</p>

<p>Looked at from this point of view, we see the whole explanation of
the existence, the amount, and the position of this synchronous period
under one rubric, if only we could grant the combination of mental
processes without interference. If mental processes go on together,
the sole ground of the imperceptibility of short periods of time separating
mental processes is in the fact that the first of these processes
<em>has not changed sufficiently to be known as different</em>, to the perceiving
subject. The minimal perceivable interval will vary from man to
man, and in the same man from time to time, inversely as the amount
of change per unit of time, in the process itself. The same statement
could be made in terms of vividness or relative clearness. The more
focal the idea or process, <em>i. e.</em>, the more vivid or relatively clear it is,
the more rapid will be the changes and the perception of those changes.
Professor MÃ¼nsterberg's physiological explanation of vividness,<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> as
due to the facilitation of the motor discharge, has already found confirmation
in the method of keenest interval discrimination as outlined
above. The more rapidly the first process can get into action,
the more is the discriminated interval shortened. So in Exner's
experiments, where it was known which of two stimuli would come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
first, the interval was very much shorter than any of my results, for
the motor preparation could be made very complete beforehand,
as in a muscular reaction. Therefore the perceptible change, upon
perception of the stimulus, occurred in a shorter time. Under any
circumstances, the conditions, subjective or objective, which make
for rapid maturing (and by the principle of dynamogenesis maturing
means going over into action) of the mental process, make also for
the shortening of the least perceptible interval.</p>

<p>These conditions are as various as the gamut of human experience
is wide. There is nothing, from the primary temperamental characteristics
to the passing wave of feeling of the present moment, which
does not affect it. Most particularly, though, is it a matter of the
relations existing among the elementary processes striving to go on
together. Among the focal and fringe elements of a given moment of
experience, no matter how carefully the practised introspectionist
may strive after an ideal condition of monoideism, there is an incessant
interaction. There are all sorts of hindrances and facilitations.
Herein is the justification of Stern's statement that the "praesenzzeit,"
as he calls it, "varies with the quantity and quality of conscious content,
the direction of attention, and the strength of psychical energy,"
and that it cannot be assigned a maximal value but rather what he
calls an "optimal value." All that is included, in fact, in the complex
rubrics, <em>attention</em> and <em>interest</em>, has to do with the length of this indiscriminable
interval.</p>

<p>Time-difference in consciousness is the very simplest thing in mental
life, for it is a case of the bare awareness of change. The elementary
time-judgment is mere judgment of change in content of consciousness.
In the experiment where one is asked to say which of two
expected stimuli comes first, however, the case is already complicated.
There must be a double preparation to react and to note the change
characteristic of each case, and so convert it into a time-judgment.
In the combination of two judgments, there is the same double expectancy,
preparation to react in two ways at once. In each experiment,
the preparation and shaping of expectation is the same as in
reaction experiments. In all reaction work, the short reaction comes
as the result of catching the attention wave at its most favorable point.
If the signal to react catches the idea of reaction in the mind of
the observer at the very focal point in consciousness, the shortest
reaction possible under the given conditions results. So in both the
combination experiment and the interval discrimination experiment,
it is very necessary to catch the attention wave, <em>equally prepared for</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
<em>both or all the processes</em>, and at the highest crest of advancement.
Both demand the same preparation as a compound reaction. I believe
it is this inequality of balance of the attention between the
various processes that is responsible for the interference which is evidenced
in my results. This is my explanation of the appearance
of impaired accuracy for combinations for a given observer under
some conditions and the failure of any sign of impaired accuracy for
the same observer under other experimental conditions, or even under
the same experimental conditions at different times.</p>

<p>In the time-interval discrimination experiment the evenness of
balance in the attention wave will make for the shortest interval
discrimination, and the proportion between the two will be direct,
so far as other factors do not interfere. But there are special interferences
here. One of these is the fact that the two mental processes
do not set off at the same moment. No matter how even the balance in
attention at the moment of impact of the first of the two stimuli, the
preparation for the other, not yet set off, cannot be held in equal
readiness while this is going off. This discharge has already disturbed
the preparation to discharge in the other direction. In the
case of a given pair of stimuli of definite qualities and intensities, the
relation will be one of mutual facilitation for one interval of separation
and one of inhibition for another interval. In one case the first opens
the path for the second, being a case similar to the summation of
stimuli, and in the other, it draws all the available energy in its own
direction.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_ESTIMATION_OF_NUMBER" id="THE_ESTIMATION_OF_NUMBER"></a>THE ESTIMATION OF NUMBER</h2>

<p class="p1b">BY C. T. BURNETT</p>


<p>I. There are situations not a few in life in which we find ourselves
estimating the number of objects in some group. Sometimes we desire
to know merely whether the group is large or small. Sometimes
we try to reach an absolute number that shall approximate roughly
to the real number. Sometimes, again, we only care to know whether
the group in question is more or less numerous than some other
group that we have before us or perhaps recall in memory. The
public speaker finds himself wondering whether this present scattering
audience is larger than the one that last night crowded into
the front seats. The farmer riding between adjoining orchards
judges roughly the prospective yield by a comparative estimate of
the fruit in sight. The politician too has an interest that is very notable
indeed in such rough numerical estimates. He asks himself,
for example, whether the voters will be more influenced by reports
favorable to his party sent in from numerous small towns or by such
reports from a few large centres. Or perhaps he is planning a demonstration
in favor of his candidate. His problem then is so to
arrange his procession that five hundred men will look like five thousand.
Turning to another field, how is it that the enrolment in
some institutions of learning seems larger and the size of the faculty
more portentous than in other similar institutions that are really
of about the same size?</p>

<p>These examples bring to mind our interest in rough numerical
estimates and at the same time suggest the probability that we are
swayed back and forth in these estimations without ever a numerical
difference occurring in the objects of our judgment. These considerations
lead us on, then, to an enquiry about the factors that
can thus influence our estimation of number.</p>

<p>The experiments described in the following pages are concerned
with the influence exerted on the judgment of a given factor by other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
factors presented at the same time. The object of judgment in these
studies is visual number, which is to be submitted under varying
conditions of the objects whose number is in question, for example,
varying conditions of form, size, distribution, with the intent to discover
whether this judgment is a function of these other factors as
well as of the numerical. The scope of the enquiry includes both
relative and absolute number.</p>

<p>The objects chosen as a basis for the number-judgment were bits
of paper pasted in two well-defined groups side by side upon a background
of black cardboard. This card fitted into an upright frame
where it was held in place by a pivoted spring, which allowed easy
adjustment and removal of the card. The opening of the frame,
15Ã20 cm. was concealed at will from the observer by a black
wooden screen that played up and down on guiding posts, when
released by a cord and lever from the catch that held it in place
before the card. It fell by gravity upon a cushion that deadened
the sound; and it was restored to its position by the operator's thrusting
his fingers beneath and lifting it till the catch above caught and
held. The entire apparatus, as well as the operator's movements,
was concealed from the observer by a large black cardboard screen
resting upon a black-covered table. The one opening in this screen
was just large enough to allow a full view of the card when the inner
wooden screen fell from sight.</p>

<p>This apparatus which we will call the Two-Group Apparatus,
admitted of simultaneous exposure of the two groups of objects,
and that only. At first, to make successive exposure possible, a light
wooden frame was constructed in whose grooves two leaves of black
cardboard ran like sliding doors. By means of rods fastened to their
outer edges these leaves could be pulled apart or thrust together till
their inner edges met. When this apparatus was placed between
the outer screen and the frame bearing the card, and the inner wooden
screen had been dropped out of the way, this substitute divided
screen was sufficient roughly to accomplish the end in view.</p>

<p>With this apparatus the illumination was daylight, coming through
a very large window at the back of the observers. By means of a
curtain, marked variations in the light could be prevented.</p>

<p>For the length of simultaneous exposure of the groups the following
rule was adopted: Each observer was to be allowed time enough
to get a satisfactory feeling of relative number, but not time enough
to admit of counting. This time was kept constant during the work
of any one sitting. As the weeks went on, it was found possible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
under the rule laid down above, to shorten the time for some of the
observers, and to use with all the same length of exposure that had
sufficed for the speediest. The range of variation was from 1.2 sec.
to 1.6 sec. Time was measured by the ticks of a watch. Later tests
showed for the time studied that, where effective at all, the longer
exposure diminished a given tendency. Often it had no apparent
effect.</p>

<p>The method of control already described is not only rather rough
but does not exclude the possibility of a space error. This possibility
proved actual by experiment. So an apparatus was contrived
that should present the groups in succession at approximately the
same place and should shorten the exposure, if desirable, to a small
fraction of a second.</p>

<p>This new apparatus, which we will call the One-Group Apparatus,
required artificial light and a dark room. By means of a 125 cp. incandescent
electric lamp, images of the groups of objects were reflected
through the lens of a camera and came to a focus upon its
ground-glass screen. A second screen of ground glass was placed
in front of the first and as close to it as possible, that an even distribution
of light might be obtained. The cards containing the objects
were of the same general character as in the earlier experiments.
They were held in a moveable slide whereby each group in succession
could be brought before the lens. When the slide was drawn to the
limit in one direction a single circle appeared in a black field. This
circle was used as a signal and a means for directing the eye in the
dark to that region where the groups were to appear. The exposures
were made with a camera bulb, the shutter being set for instantaneous
movement, with diaphragm 22 and length of exposure
<span class="hfrac"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">26</span></span> sec. A shorter time was thought on trial to make perception too
difficult. The apparatus rested upon a table of special construction
and was enclosed as far as the glass screen with a wooden frame
covered with denim. Double curtains of this material formed this
enclosure on one side and made possible an easy adjustment of the
cards between exposures, as well as the admission of the operator's
hand during a given experiment for the adjustment of the shutter.
This had to be set, of course, before each of the three exposures
constituting one experiment. During its progress the hand was not
removed at all, the curtains falling about the arm in such a way that
little light escaped. The other hand managed the moveable slide
from behind the enclosure.</p>

<p>Time was measured by watch-ticks. The three exposures&mdash;dot-signal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
Group 1, Group 2&mdash;were separated from each other by intervals
of 1.6 sec. This was fixed upon as the minimum for convenient
operation of the apparatus.</p>

<p>In much of the experimentation on relative number two observers
were employed at once. Their chairs were placed closely side by
side on a line about 150 cm. from the plane in which the groups appeared.
These groups were not very far from being on a level with
the eye. Each observer recorded his own judgment, against the
number of that experiment. There were three possible kinds of judgments,&mdash;equality
or either group larger. If the judgment was of
difference it was recorded in terms of the larger.</p>

<p>When the dark room was used, special arrangements were required,
for convenience of the observers in making their record. After several
schemes were tested the following was adopted as least trying to their
eyes: A large, black-topped table was placed before them, bearing
an electric lamp enclosed in a black box with a small aperture that
could be closed at pleasure; or, if left open, did not let enough
light escape to disturb the perception of the groups.</p>

<p>The absolute number of objects in the groups was determined,
first, by the character of the problem, and then by convenience.
If we are to learn anything about the influence exerted upon the
number-judgment by other factors than the numerical, we must
eliminate all influence of the latter. Correct judgments may be determined
by this factor alone; erroneous judgments must have been
otherwise conditioned; and these conditions it is the task of our
method to isolate and study, as modifying factors. From correct
judgments we learn nothing definite about our problem, but from
erroneous everything. Other things being equal, it is preferable to
eliminate from the results the influence of this numerical factor,
just as one handles any other disturbing, unavoidable element, by
equalizing the numbers in the two groups.</p>

<p>What may be called the standard number of objects in each is
twenty. This choice was governed by the purpose of using a number
large enough to make counting impossible in a brief time and
yet not so large as unnecessarily to increase the labor of preparation
and the difficulty, for the observer, of getting an idea of the groups
as a whole. To the cards containing equal groups, 20 to 20, were
added others, 20 to 19, 19 to 20, for the purpose of easy variation
in arrangement, by omitting one object from a group, without
making the actual numerical difference easily perceivable. In later
work these small objective differences were dropped. Yet other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
cards, 23 to 17, 17 to 23, were added, to the end that the observers
might find unmistakeable number-differences, and so not be bothered
by the suspicion that the groups were all equal. The reversal of the
number-relations, as indicated above, was in the interest of equalizing
the influence of the actual numerical factor in the two groups.</p>

<p>The following proportion was kept among the numbers of observations
made upon each kind of card: <span class="hfrac"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">2</span></span> upon groups objectively
equal; <span class="hfrac"><span class="numerator">5</span><span class="denominator">12</span></span> upon those differing by one from each other, where half
each went to (20 to 19) and (19 to 20); <span class="hfrac"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">12</span></span> to those showing the maximum
objective difference of six, where again half went to (17 to 23)
and half to (23 to 17). Of course the observations upon cards of this
last sort are excluded from the tables.</p>

<p>As to the number of cards employed for each series of experiments,
it was found at first convenient to use seven,&mdash;3 (20 to 20),
1 (20 to 19), 1 (19 to 20), 1 (17 to 23), 1 (23 to 17). In each group
the arrangement of objects was irregular. The use of three of the
first sort was to encourage freshness of judgment, each having its
particular irregularity. Cards were but rarely remembered, practically
never except in the case of groups differing widely in number.
So far as the observers could tell, judgment was formed afresh in
all these cases. In later experiments eight cards were used. This
number was in the interest of avoiding the distribution-error. At
first it was thought sufficient that all the groups should be merely
irregular. Later it became evident that discrimination was very fine
here and so that this factor must be eliminated by the usual precise
method.</p>

<p>The space- and time-errors, where likely to be present, were eliminated
in the usual way by performing an equal number of experiments
with the groups in reversed arrangement. Several methods
of doing this were at first tried; but these were all abandoned in
favor of the following: The experiments were arranged in sets of
24, in each of which the proportion of kinds of cards was kept as
indicated above. Each set with one space- or time-order of the groups
was repeated with that arrangement reversed.</p>

<p>A word must be added as to the arrangement of results in the
tables. Judgments of equality upon objectively unequal groups are
entered as overestimations of the smaller groups. The per cent of
correct judgments is equally divided between the two other classes,
and for this reason that interest centres, not in correctness at all, but
in the difference between the tendency of error in one direction and
that in the other direction. No doubtful judgments were admitted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
but in such cases another trial was allowed later, usually when the
observer was not aware that he was being given a new chance. The
subjects are divided into three classes according as the results show
a tendency to favor one or the other group or no tendency either
way. A difference of 10% is arbitrarily taken as significant.</p>

<p>1. <em>The Influence of Group-Area.</em> The Two-Group Apparatus
was employed. The four sets of experiments carried out with this
factor differed primarily in the material upon which the observer's
judgment was based, and secondarily in certain matters of method.
The attempt in them all was to approximate more completely to the
isolation of the factor under investigation. They are numbered in
the order of approximation. As marked results were obtained from
each, they have all been offered for consideration in the four parts
of Table I. A description of the material used in each case follows.</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Squares (1 cm.) Neutral Gray no. 1. (Bradley), arranged
irregularly in two groups with irregular outlines on a background
of black cardboard. One group was large in area, the other small,
the attempt being made to fill each space homogeneously. Groups
were not proportional in shape of area.</p>

<p><em>B.</em> As above, save that circles (11 mm. approx. in diameter)
were substituted for squares, in the interest of distinctness for the
several objects.</p>

<p><em>C.</em> The area of the groups was oblong and regular, and the sides
were proportional. (Compact 72.5 mm.: 58 mm.; scattered 110 mm.:
88 mm. These relations were determined by the size of the frame
that had already been used and by the desire to make the difference
in area as marked as other necessary conditions would admit.) Each
area was marked by a circle in each corner. The color of the compact
group was the deepest shade of normal gray (Prang Normal
Gray Darker); of scattered group the next higher shade (Normal
Gray Dark). These dark grays were used in order to reduce to a
minimum the tendency to produce after-images. The difference in
the shades of the two groups was in the interest of avoiding the greater
brightness due to the mass-effect of the compact group.</p>

<p><em>D.</em> As in C, except that India ink outline circles ( <span class="hfrac"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">3</span></span> to <span class="hfrac"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">2</span></span> mm. line)
were used on a background of granite cardboard. This change was
made to avoid, as far as possible, the greater mass-stimulation due
to the reÃ«nforcing effect of the compact arrangement. The size of
circles remained as before.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The per cent recorded in the no-tendency class is an average of <em>all</em> per cents below 10, whether in
favor of the one or the other of the two remaining classes. This is true for all the following tables.</p></blockquote>

<p>The following facts are presented by the several parts of Table I:
(1) The large per cents of difference show that area is to a large
extent a determinant of the judgment of relative number. (2) Different
subjects show opposite tendencies. (3) A comparison of the
results of individual subjects through the four series shows that
this opposition in tendency occurs in the same subject at different
times. The introspective notes of one of these subjects show the
internal process of change from one tendency to the other. It consists
in a gradual increase of analytic activity toward the compact
group. At first glance the composition of the scattered group was
more evident; but when attention was fairly turned toward the
compact, the inability to isolate objects made them seem very numerous.
The importance of a coÃ¶perating subjective factor is here
evident. (4) Out of a possible 57 cases there are but 10 showing
no tendency.</p>

<p>2. <em>The Influence of the Internal Arrangement.</em> As before, the
Two-Group Apparatus was employed; and the factor was studied
in three aspects.</p>

<p><em>A.</em> The material consisted of two groups of gray circles (Normal
Gray Darker, Prang) covering equal areas. In one group this area
was filled homogeneously, in the other the circles were gathered
into nuclei. In order that there might be exactly the same relation
of parts when the cards were reversed, each group was so arranged
on a diagonal axis of symmetry from upper left to lower right corner
that each half repeated the other in reverse order. Otherwise the
arrangement of circles was irregular.</p>

<p>Six cards only were used,&mdash;four (20 to 20), one (17 to 23), and
one (23 to 17). Slight differences among them occurred in the
arrangement of the equality-cards, which might help to counteract<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
any incipient reasoning from sameness of appearance to sameness
of number. The large increase in the difference-values is accounted
for in part by the fact that the cards (19 to 20) and (20 to 19) were
omitted, and for this reason: that when an observer tended largely
to favor a particular group, the introduction of a card in which
that group was objectively greater would mean an increase in the
number of correct judgments; whereas the introduction of two
objectively equal groups for the others would increase considerably
the number of erroneous judgments.</p>

<p><em>B.</em> The numerical character of the cards here used shows a return
to the usual. The material was like that of <em>A</em>, except for a new
internal arrangement. Here the area of one group was filled homogeneously,
while that of the other contained a pattern of this sort:
An ellipse just contained within the boundaries of the normal area;
a circle in each of the four corners of that area; and in the centre
a diamond formed of four circles. Numerical changes were always
confined to the ellipse, as less open to counting than the rest of the
figure.</p>

<p><em>C.</em> Material and method repeat <em>B</em> but with another internal arrangement.
One group, as before, showed an area homogeneously
filled, and irregularly, as usual. The other group carries to an extreme
the distinction of open and filled space made prominent in
the other groups of this table by massing the circles in an outline
completely enclosing the area and in a diagonal from upper left to
lower right corner. The outline did not show even spacing; more
circles were crowded in one part than in others, that counting might
be more difficult.</p>

<p>That there might be no attempt to remember cards, in all cases
where there were twenty objects in the homogeneous group the same
kind of irregular arrangement was repeated. This is a different
method from that employed in <em>A</em>. Since the length of exposure was
so short and the arrangement in the group irregular, either one is
probably as good as the other.</p>

<p><em>D.</em> The material used for <em>B</em> and <em>C</em> had a kind of regularity, since
definite patterns were used. The introspection of the observers
showed, however, that the patterns as such were not in question in
the judgment, but rather the vacancies and the crowding. With the
Two-Group Apparatus an arrangement in parallel lines could
rather easily be counted, but with the One-Group Apparatus and
its means for instantaneous exposure this difficulty was to some
extent overcome. The arrangement of the objects in parallel lines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
was therefore adopted and matched against the irregularity of an
accompanying group. The same size of group-area was kept, but the
small difference-cards were omitted. There was no other change
beyond those made necessary by the apparatus and already indicated
on an earlier page. The length of exposure was <span class="hfrac"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">25</span></span> sec. The
bearing of this time-factor on the results will be considered in a
later section.</p>

<p>The several parts of Table II give us the following facts: (1) The
judgment of relative number is very markedly a function of the
internal arrangement. (2) The marked tendency among the observers
to favor the homogeneous in <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> meets a check in <em>C</em>. Recalling
the direction of difference between <em>C</em> and the other sets, that
in <em>C</em> the gradually increasing contrast between the inner vacancies
and the filling reaches a maximum, we may suspect that these vacancies
begin to seem no longer a part of the group-situation, while
the compactness of the filling, where it does occur, is thrust prominently
forward. The notes of the observers confirm this suspicion.
(3) The results of the different subjects show that the shifting of
tendencies occurs as before. (4) As to the way in which regularity
functions in the judgment, the notes of one observer are very clear.
The blank spaces in the irregular are noticeable, he says, which is
not true of the regular, where, on the contrary, one has a feeling of
compactness of figure. I am able to confirm this character of the
spaces by my experience outside this experiment. A simple pattern
is very easily apprehended and irrelevancies of the background
dismissed. Increase its complexity to a maximum, as in the case of
an irregular group, and I am almost at a halt to isolate objects from
their fellows and maintain them apart, yet together. The background
is hardly to be shut out. This is probably due to the absence
of a centrally excited image of the group. The object and the not-object
run together. (5) The position of the single observer in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
no-tendency class of <em>D</em> was marked subjectively by great difficulty
in forming a judgment. The groups seemed incomparable, the
vividness of form excluding the perception of number.</p>

<p>3. <em>The Influence of Complexity in Group-Composition.</em></p>

<p>Complexity of group-content was attained by introducing objects
of different colors; so there was not a clean isolation of factors.
By comparing these results with those recorded in Table IV, A, we
shall be able somewhat roughly to make allowance for the factor of
mere color.</p>

<p>Sets of 132 experiments each from sixteen observers were obtained
for each of these factors. Unfortunately the distribution-error was
not eliminated. Later experiments showed the importance of this
factor, and, in consequence, the impossibility of interpreting the
results under consideration. So new experiments were performed
under the proper conditions, but at a time when only a few of the
first observers could be used. Their results from the earlier series
are given in Table III, A. The exclusion of the small-difference cards
from the later series (Table III, B) and the consequent increase of
the number of experiments on objective equality prevent comparison.</p>

<p>The material in <em>A</em> consisted of two groups of circles of the usual
size, one Normal Gray (Prang), the other of three colors&mdash;Red,
Yellow Orange Shade 2 (Bradley), Light Blue Blue Green (Prang).
The intent was to equalize the two groups in brightness. When
the observers were questioned about the relative brightness, supporters
were found for all three possible opinions. So it seems probable
that the groups did not differ widely in this respect. As nearly
as the number-condition would allow, the three colors were represented
equally in the group; and they were distributed so as to make
the whole as homogeneous as possible.</p>

<p>In <em>B</em> the changes were the correction for distribution as described
in the introduction to this section, and the substitution of equality-cards
for those of slight numerical difference. In addition, three
other colors replaced those of <em>A</em>, in the interest of regulated brightness
and more pleasing Ã¦sthetic effect. These were, in the Bradley
system of broken spectrum scales, A-Red, medium; A-Yellow Orange,
dark; A-Blue Green, dark. With these exceptions <em>B</em> was like <em>A</em>.
The observers were all inclined to consider the gray brighter than
the mixed. The Two-Group Apparatus was used.</p>

<p>The following facts may be gathered from Table III: (1) The
tendency to overestimate the gray is due in part at least to the additional
factor of complexity in the other group, as is shown by the
markedly changed tendencies in Table IV, A, where a solid color takes
the place of the mixed colors. The actual colors involved in the two
cases are different, to be sure, and necessarily so, and this difference
may of course be invoked as the cause, as well as a possible difference
in brightness between the gray and mixed in III, B. The introspective
notes help us here. One observer felt that he favored the
gray primarily because there was a tendency to consider but one
color in the mixed. Another was drawn toward the gray because
it seemed definite and consistent. For both of these observers Ã¦sthetic
elements were involved in favor of the gray. The latter found
also that the greater brightness of the gray gave it a larger area.
With a third subject the fact of variety was felt as decidedly important;
but his notes show a conflict between this factor and that of distribution
which was the conscious basis for his normal judgment.</p>

<p>4. <em>The Influence of Differences in the Kind of Objects.</em></p>

<p><em>A. The Factor of Color.</em> The material in A 1 consisted of two
groups of circles of the usual size, one Normal Gray (Prang), the
other Red (Bradley). The attempt was made by this choice to
equalize the brightness. The size and shape of the group-area were
those of the smaller area of Table I, C and D. In A 2 the only changes
were the correction for distribution, as described in the introduction
to this section, and the substitution of equality-cards for those of
slight numerical difference. The Two-Group Apparatus was used.</p>

<p>The following results appear in Table IV, A 1 and A 2: (1) While
complexity seemed on the whole to diminish apparent number, red
noticeably increases it. Some of the observers report that group as
more vivid and interesting. One observer compensated by emphasizing
the gray in attention, as his results showed. (2) If one ask
how the color red functioned in the judgment, the reply must apparently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
be, by its brightness and vividness. The mixed group
functioned in a double way, as vivid and so more numerous, as fragmentary
and so fewer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span></p>

<p><em>B. The Factor of Size.</em> The Two-Group Apparatus was used,
the material consisting of India ink circles (<span class="hfrac"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">3</span></span> to <span class="hfrac"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">2</span></span> mm. line) on a
background of granite paper. This paper was chosen here and for
the experiments of Table I, D, to get a suitable mean between too
sharp contrast and sufficient distinctness. The circles in the one
group were ten mm. in diameter; in the other seven mm. The two
areas were approximately equal, and of the same size as that of the
more compact group in Table I. This is in fact the standard size
throughout these studies in Relative Number, wherever area is not
in question. The small-difference cards were included.</p>

<p>Two sources of possible complication must be considered. It is
unavoidable that the factor of differences in compactness should
enter and that clean results on the basis of object-size be denied.
Our interpretation must not fail to consider this fact. Because of
this, it seems unlikely that a distribution-error should arise; so the
usual precaution to eliminate it was omitted both here and in the
study of area (Table I). Distribution affects the appearance of
the vacant spaces. When differences in the <em>amount</em> are by the conditions
inevitably prominent, differences in the <em>conformation</em> may be
safely regarded as of minimal vividness.</p>

<p>The following results appear in Table IV, B: (1) The illusion of
numerical inequality is marked for many subjects. (2) The judgment
is quite possibly a function of the two factors&mdash;object-size and
group-vacancies. If we recall the fact that the small-object group
is more scattered than the other, we shall note that the leading class
here is like the leading class in Table I, and we may fairly reckon
this factor as of importance in the issue. Of the incomplete introspective
notes on this question, those of only one observer speak
clearly for the size. He says: "There is an overpowering feeling
of predominance in case of the large and I must judge for them.
The large space covered seems an important factor. The longer I
reflect upon the relative numbers the more numerous seem the larger,
that is, they appear to increase over the small after the exposure.
It is hard to give judgments of equal in most cases."</p>

<p><em>C. The Factor of Form.</em> The material consisted of a group of
circles, each of the same size as in former material; and a group of
squares, each approximately equal to a circle of the other group.
These were made of Prang's gray paper (Normal Gray Darker) and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
pasted upon a black background. The areas of the two groups
were approximately equal. The squares were set irregularly except
for those in the corners, where the edges were placed parallel to the
edges of the card. The Two-Group Apparatus was used and the
small-difference cards included.</p>

<p>In this material, again, the formal elimination of the distribution-error
was not attempted. The striking difference in the conformation
of the vacancies through the form-differences of the objects
probably makes the repetition of the exact positions insignificant.
Still the fact must be noted.</p>

<p>The results appear in Table IV, C. (1) The illusion of numerical
inequality is here again marked for many observers. (2) The introspective
notes are not on the whole very illuminating as to the basis
of judgment. One observer, who favored circles, found that the
appearance of more orderly arrangement in squares made them seem
few. Another, who favored squares, found, on the contrary, the more
regular the more numerous, and thought that the squares may have
seemed more regular. A third, who favored circles, found the squares
better individualized, with whom a fourth agreed in both respects,
who also was influenced by the apparently greater bulkiness of the
squares. Fewer could go into a given area. A fifth, on the other hand,
who found the circles better individualized, still favored them. So
we have these observers apparently doing the same thing under
opposite conditions, and the opposite thing under the same conditions.
Here indeed is a situation for any theory. So far as we can
learn from the foregoing, the form may influence the judgment
merely through its space-characteristics, but possibly also through
the vividness of intrinsic interest.</p>

<p><em>D. The Factor of Complexity.</em> The One-Group Apparatus was
used in this work and results were obtained for two different lengths
of exposure, <span class="hfrac"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">25</span></span> sec. and <span class="hfrac"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">4</span></span> sec. The material differed, in that to the
centres of the circles of one group were added small Red (Bradley)
circles (6 mm.). With the apparatus used, the color was not very
effective, the brightness contrast between dark centres and white
periphery being chiefly prominent. The total group-brightness was
of course diminished by those centres. The small-difference cards
were omitted.</p>

<p>The results are recorded in Table IV, D 1 and D 2. (1) The illusion
is apparently strong. (2) The amounts of the difference-values
show that the shorter exposure is more favorable to the illusion.
(3) The introspective notes indicate that both brightness and complexity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
functioned in the judgment. Two observers, both of whom
show large tendencies, were not conscious of any influence of complexity.
One of these did find differences in brightness important;
and in favoring the darker group his results exactly coincide with
those of Table IV, E, where this factor is under direct consideration.
A third found the complex group interesting. With a fourth the
complex group developed in number amazingly during the few moments
after exposure and had an appearance of great intricacy,
often seeming to be in active movement. A fifth observer too felt
that its numerical character depended on its complexity.</p>

<p><em>E. The Factor of Brightness.</em> Hitherto the absolute arrangement
of the objects in any two groups compared, where this factor has
not been the object of enquiry, has been in the two cases different,
though with respect to irregularity alike. This course was governed
by a desire to avoid the substitution of a form-judgment for one on
number, through recognition of the fact that both groups had identical
forms. The resulting distribution-error I tried to eliminate in
the usual way. Tests toward the end of these studies showed that
there was no danger from this source. Errors seemed about as
frequent as before. No observer made any comment on the fact,
except one who through his official connection with the laboratory
work knew that the test would be made sometime, but not exactly
when. During many of the experiments he did not perceive the
likeness of form; and when he did the numerical judgment arose
without connection with that factor, as was shown by the feeling
that the two groups were unequal in number. He called the relative
fewness of the first group a case of "perspective effect." This must
have significance for any account of the time-error; but by no means
carries with it its own interpretation.</p>

<p>One welcome result of these tests was their assurance that I might
without fear further simplify the experimental conditions by avoiding
the possibility of a distribution-error. The material for these
experiments on brightness therefore profited by this possibility.
Each card had a different specific irregularity, but always in duplicate.
In choosing the degree of brightness-difference Prang's brightest
shade of normal gray was found as dark as could be conveniently
perceived with the artificial light of the One-Group Apparatus.
The contrast between this shade and white was quite evident enough
for the purpose. The small-difference cards were omitted.</p>

<p>Table IV, E, shows the decisive character of the results. The observers
fall all into one class in favoring the darker group, and by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
a large difference-value. The following introspection of one observer
shows the extent to which the factors of brightness and number
fuse: "I frequently lose sight of time-order. It is a question of number
and not one of light-intensity, and if called upon to state which
group came first I might not be able to answer. In equality-judgments
the difference of light comes out distinctly."</p>

<p>5. <em>The Influence of Complexity of Environment.</em></p>

<p>The material prepared for these experiments certainly lays stress
upon <em>relative</em>, not <em>absolute</em>, complexity; for the conditions were
satisfied by placing 5 mm. strips of white paper, equal in length
to the width of a group, a few millimetres off at the top and the bottom
of the groups that were on one side of the cards. The One-Group
Apparatus was used and the small-difference cards omitted.</p>

markedly favors the other group. (2) The notes of the observers
indicate that the added strips functioned through their effect upon
the apparent area of their group. The observers all found the dimensions
increased; but with some, apparently by contrast, the
added height brought out sharply the narrowness. One observer
found this true in general; another, when the barred group came
first. The latter says: "The unbarred group, coming first, appears
to reflect its compact character on the barred one, when it comes,
so that it does not look so attenuated and strange." Here the image
brought over to the second took the width of the second somewhat
out of relation to its illusory height, whereas in the reverse order
the contrast relation was fully maintained.</p>

<p>A very simple apparatus was employed. The objects whose number
was in question were bright steel balls (3/8 inch) thrown loosely
into square black frames, 13 cm. inside, placed side by side on a black-topped
table. The experiments were performed in series of 30.
The groups were kept equal numerically, with this exception, that
into each series were introduced four experiments where the groups
were so unequal that the observer could have no question as to the
correctness of his judgment and the existence of objective differences.
This numerical superiority was given to each group alternately,
and judgments on it were, of course, excluded from the
results. The actual numbers employed in a series varied between
35 and 60 in accordance with the following scheme:</p>

<p class="lefta">1. &nbsp; 50 each<br />
2. &nbsp; 45  &nbsp; "<br />
3. &nbsp; 50 &nbsp; "<br />
4. &nbsp; 55 &nbsp; "<br />

8. &nbsp; 40 &nbsp; "<br />
9. &nbsp; 45 &nbsp; "<br />

27. 60 &nbsp; "<br />
28. 55 &nbsp; "<br />
29. 50 &nbsp; "<br />
30. 45 to 60</p>

<p>The time of a single exposure&mdash;in this case two groups at once&mdash;was
3 sec. measured by a stop-watch. As to the arrangement of
the balls, care was taken that they should not be massed in one
place, but scattered somewhat homogeneously over the space within
the frames. The illumination was daylight, so managed that shadows
cast by the balls were reduced to a minimum. The observer
sat close to the table with the groups directly in front of him. He
either kept his eyes closed between experiments or held a small
screen before them. Sometimes he merely turned away. The operator
worked from the opposite side of the table, taking care to make
the necessary noises as little suggestive as possible. The observers
agreed that they were not consciously influenced by the manipulation.</p>

<p>The progress of these experiments disclosed an astonishing space-error.
So far as was conveniently possible the usual technique of
elimination was employed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span></p>

<p>1. <em>The Influence of Active Pressure.</em></p>

<p>In this study the groups were differentiated in this way: With
one hand the observer rolled the balls of one group under his fingers,
while the other group was presented to vision only. The method of
observation consisted in rapidly and lightly rolling the balls under
the fingers a few times and then surveying both groups visually for
the remainder of the exposure, judgment being given on the visual
number.</p>

<p>Evidently there is much that is rough about this procedure. Pressure
and kinÃ¦sthetic factors are lumped off together; the length of
the touch-stimulus was not exactly determined; and there is the
possibility that the visual stimulation from the group touched is
weakened. To be sure the method prevents any great difference
in the latter respect; and if we are guarded in our interpretation,
something of interest may be learned.</p>

<p>There appeared to be no convenient way to eliminate the space-error.
The right hand was used with the right group and the left
with the left. So here again interpretation must be circumspect.</p>

<p>Turning to the results in Table VI, A, we find the following: (1)
The influence of the pressure-kinÃ¦sthetic complex practically does
not appear; while the space-error shows a marked tendency that,
for the two observers, is in opposite directions. (2) On the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
hand, the notes of one observer show that in his case at least the face
value of the table is erroneous. To this effect he says in substance
that he can make a more accurate estimate of the number in the
group touched. He tries to ignore these sensations of touch, but with
ill success in the case of the left hand, where clumsiness not only
makes it difficult to touch the balls gently but also to keep them under
the fingers, which often feel the ground-space. For this cause the
group seems small in number. Clearly enough, then, it is the space-error
that tells the story of the effect of the added stimuli on this
observer, only it must not be interpreted as space-error. The pressure
functioned in the judgment through its numerical aspect. But
the positive effect with the right hand was turned to a negative with
the left through its emphasis of vacancies. The high difference-value
in the space-column becomes thus a striking evidence of the
effect of pressure, and the results are accounted for without reference
to the kinÃ¦sthetic factor. The other observer felt that the active
pressure was relatively indifferent. (3) The entire absence of correct
judgments on the objectively equal groups shows to what a surprising
extent other factors have modified the numerical.</p>


<p>2. <em>The Influence of Unevenness in Active Pressure-Feeling.</em></p>

<p>In the experiments of this section the groups differed in this way,
that one rested on the smooth table-top while the other had for its
bottom a coarse wire mesh covered with black cloth. The balls of
the one rolled smoothly beneath the fingers while the other balls
moved lumpily over their mesh. Both hands were used&mdash;each for
the group on its side; and the method of observation and length
of exposure agreed with those conditions in the preceding section,
except that the balls were rolled a little more vigorously that the
factor studied might come clearly into consciousness. The groups
were interchanged for half the number of series. This could not of
course completely eliminate the space-error, since kinÃ¦sthetic differences
in the limbs remained uncompensated. In general the
criticism in the preceding section is again applicable.</p>

<p>The results appear in Table VI, B. (1) One observer shows a tendency
to favor the smoothly rolling group, while the other again shows
no tendency. Both have large space-errors of the same character
as in A of this table. (2) The introspection of the observer showing
no tendency is to the effect that touch plays little or no conscious
part in the situation. The other's notes give no hint that the factor
studied here was influential; but to the effect on the judgment of
touch in general, especially with the right hand, they give clear witness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
The touch-sensations, he says, were difficult to ignore. Those
from the right hand were more vivid than those from the left; and
the right hand seemed more sensitive. Judgment was based on a
general feeling of "moreishness" which came promptly. There
is nothing to contradict the evidence of the earlier experiments that
touch is again influential through its numerical character. (3) Both
observers regard factors of distribution as of fundamental importance,
though one was inclined at first to insist that there was nothing
but number in his judgment. The significance of this unanalyzed
feeling will appear in a later section. (4) These results
agree with the preceding in the approximate exclusion of correct
judgments.</p>


<p>3. <em>The Influence of Active Weight.</em></p>

<p>The variation here in question consisted in lifting one of the groups
during judgment of the relative number in the two groups. The apparatus
was made by transforming into trays the frames containing the
balls, by putting into these frames wire-mesh bottoms covered with
black cloth. They were set each upon four small wooden pillars so
that the hand could be easily thrust under the tray. At the signal
a given tray was several times raised a little way and lowered, and
the judgment formed on the same factor as before. Here again the
space-error was not entirely eliminated. Each hand was used with
the group on its side, but kinÃ¦sthetic differences peculiar to each of
the limbs remained. There was always some motion among the
balls in the lifted tray, though the gentleness of the lifting prevented
the existence of much. This is a radical defect, but one not easily
avoided with maintenance of other desirable conditions. Even more
serious, as the issue proved, was the failure to control the lifting
impulse; yet, as it happens, we are not prevented from getting an
experimental answer to our question.</p>

<p>The results are recorded in Table VI, C. (1) They show no apparent
effect of the weight, and with one observer the further unusual fact
of no space-error. This error is marked enough in the case of the
other, and, conforming in direction to that of the preceding sections
of this table, allows us in so far to adopt the same interpretation of
his results. (2) The introspection of one observer was to the effect
that he felt a tendency toward a modification of the number-judgment
by weight. It was especially strong when the group was lighter
or heavier than was anticipated, the light group seeming less numerous,
and the heavy group more. Occasionally he caught himself
weighing the second group mentally; and sometimes he had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
recover himself from a tendency to make judgments on a wrong basis,
presumably that of mere weight. With such a conflict of tendencies
the character of the results is not surprising. Particularly important
are the opposing tendencies lying in the factor of weight itself. The
other observer reported that a very heavy weight exerted an influence
that it was hard but not impossible to ignore, while a lighter weight
did not effectively enter the situation at all. His earlier inclination
to say that there was nothing but number in his judgment inclines
one to believe that fusion of factors may have passed beyond the
stage of ready analysis. (3) Our analysis has given us reason to
believe that active weight has a definite tendency to modify the
judgment of relative number.</p>


<p>4. <em>The Influence of Muscular Strain in Observation.</em></p>

<p>The study was made from the point of view of more than one set
of experimental conditions, viz.:</p>

<blockquote><p class="lefta">(1) Equal strain (minimum).<br />
<span class="mleft2">(<em>a</em>) Right&mdash;left.</span><br />
<span class="mleft2">(<em>b</em>) Up&mdash;down.</span><br />
(2) Equal strain (maximum) eyes turned.<br />
(3) Strain <em>vs.</em> ease.<br />
<span class="mleft2">(<em>a</em>) Head and eyes turned.</span><br />
<span class="mleft2">(<em>b</em>) Eyes turned.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>The conditions of (1) (<em>a</em>) were exactly those of the earlier experiments
with the exception that the groups were undistinguished
save by position. In (1) (<em>b</em>) one group was so placed between the
other and the observer that there might be as little increased effort
as possible in viewing the farther. In the up-down movement more
muscles are involved in the lift than in the fall of the eye. So
really we have here a case of (3) but not so marked. In (2) the groups
were put to the right and left at such distances that, when sitting
between, the observer could just take each one in without turning
his head. This brought a decided strain upon the eye-muscles. In
(3) (<em>a</em>) the groups were separated by the length of the table&mdash;a
distance of 90 cm.; and the observer placed in alternate series before
each; as he was in (3) (<em>b</em>) where the farther group was carried
to the limit of vision to be reached without turning the head. Here
the strain was like that in (2), but for one group only.</p>

<p>An incompleteness in experimental analysis lies in the impossibility
of separating the factors of distance and strain.</p>

<p>(2) The only inconsistency in the strain-distance complex is with
Baldwin in E. He reported that the more distant group appeared
rather as an undifferentiated mass whose number was not so well
obtained, while in the near the individuals were significant. He seemed
to be in the midst of these. The case seems analogous to that of the
observer whose introspection was reported under Table I, and who
at first accepted what we may call the objective analysis, by which
the scattered group gave up more distinct objects than the compact;
but later attempting voluntarily to disintegrate the compact,
found a bewildering confusion in the task that made this group
seem very numerous, and brought about in the end an exact reversal
of tendency. (3) Can we now separate in the results between
the influences of strain and of distance? So far we have regarded
them as one complex. But the introspections speak merely of the
space-characters of the objects, Hutchison agreeing with Baldwin
that the more remote group is judged as an area rather than as a
collection of definite objects. (4) The almost entire absence of correct
judgments in these experiments adds new evidence to that of the
immediately preceding experiments in proof of the insignificance of
the actual numerical relation for the judgment of relative number.</p>

<p>The One-Group Apparatus was employed, and cards in general
corresponding to those where area was not in question,&mdash;white-circle
groups equal in size and irregular in inner distribution,
which was not duplicated on the same card, though the resulting
distribution-error was formally eliminated in the usual way. The
usual care was taken to fill the group-area homogeneously. The
small-difference cards were retained at first; but on later discovering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
the possibility of duplication a few supplementary experiments were
added.</p>


<p>1. <em>The Influence of Touch.</em></p>

<p>The apparatus employed to give the touch-stimulus consisted in
a long lever attached to the armature of a small electro-magnet.
In the end of the lever was inserted at right angles a wooden peg,
cork-tipped. In view of the other conditions of the experiment a
convenient spot for the application of the stimulus was found to be
the forehead where it curves backward above the right eye. The
apparatus was supported by rods and clamps upon a long upright
steel rod set in an iron base and placed behind the chairs of the observers.
The same rod carried a head-rest, designed not as a support
but merely to show the observer that he had returned to the original
position after he had bent forward to record judgment. Where
two observers were used at once two sets of this apparatus were employed,
with the magnets in a single circuit governed by a floor-button.
The touch-stimulus was made to coincide as closely as possible
with the appearance of a given group.</p>

<p>In view of the practical remoteness of this factor from the object
of judgment the experimentation here took two forms,&mdash;one in
which the observer was passive toward the touch-stimulus; the
other in which the effort was made closely to associate the touch
with the visual group by imagining the group to be responsible for
the touch. For the passive method the touch was given irregularly
now on the first and now on the last, but as many times on one as
on the other.</p>

<p>For the active method, it was given always on the last group. This
constancy was held to favor the active association of touch and particular
group. The constant time-error was guarded against by experiments
in which no modifying factor was introduced. A and B
of Table VIII present the results of the passive and active methods
respectively. C and D repeat A with duplication of groups,&mdash;C
with the usual (1/25 sec.), D with a longer, exposure. These last sets
were taken that the factor of touch might be studied when the objective
conditions of the strong distribution influence should have
been removed. It might prove that a factor swamped in the former
situation might emerge into effectiveness.</p>

<p>The following summary gathers the chief facts of Table VIII: (1)
Touch appears practically without effect in A. (2) In B, the results
for touch seem again insignificant; but comparison with the control-results,
to isolate touch from time-order, while it shows no marked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
change for Angier, does show for the others that touch was effective
in determining the direction of error by difference-values, in the two
cases of 10.2 and 14 per cent. The active method seems to be
slightly more favorable to the influence of touch. (3) The duplication
of the groups in C gives a large increase to the apparent
effectiveness of touch, which is considerably diminished but not
destroyed by the lengthening of the exposure in D. (4) The introspection
for A indicates that touch under these experimental conditions
has little subjective importance for the judgment of number.
It is sometimes quite unnoticed. Angier made a possible exception
in its favor in cases of great hesitancy where it added "importance"
to the group with which it occurred. Usually he felt little doubt.
With Shaw the touch was at first distracting but later indifferent.
Johnston's notes indicate rather more effect. The touch prevented
strict attention to the figure impression whereby the space-intervals
in that group lost in value. Later it lost its confusing effect. Here
seems to be subjective tendency, but not enough to predominate in
results.</p>

<p>Results in B for the subjects separately were as follows: Angier 4%, Johnston 8.2%, Shaw
5%, all, so far as they went, in favor of the touch-group. Control experiments to determine
the time-error gave the following results: Angier 6.8% in favor of the group last seen, Johnston
2.2%, and Shaw 9% in favor of the first group.</p></blockquote>

<p>Some further introspective evidence appears in connection with
the active method of B. Angier confirms his earlier account exactly.
Usually the factors of distribution practically associated with number
determine the judgment promptly; but in cases of doubt the touch
is felt to add to its group something that appears as number-value.
Johnston's subjective situation seems a little complicated. I may
summarize thus: (<em>a</em>) The connection between the touch and its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
group being established, that group seems smaller, as being, together
with the touch, somewhere nearly equal to the first. (<em>b</em>) The connection
established and touch failing to come, that group seems
smaller. (<em>c</em>) The connection not established and attention being concentrated
on the visual impression, the touch-group feels much
larger. The curious attitude in (<em>a</em>) results in a discounting in advance
of the actual number. This done, the touch adds numerical
value to its group. In (<em>c</em>) the effort at abstraction appears to emphasize
the second (touch) group. Later, he reported similarly that
the touch-stimulus seemed to add to the number of circles in its group
even when the judgment favored the other group; and that "any
outside stimulus connected with the one of two exposures tends to
lose its own significance and be translated into number of dots to
help the accompanying exposure to equal or exceed the first." The
touch-group is felt to have more significance through association
with an idea of superior energy or greater motor impulse.</p>

<p>Of the character of the influence exerted by the touch, Shaw reported
that there seemed to be a diminution in the size of the first
group and something extra in the second. More specifically, this
effect appeared at times as an added circle at the right of the second
(touch) group. He thought that this effect was overruled by the
real bases of number-judgment which he summarized as "size, regularity,
density, etc."</p>

<p>These notes show a definite tendency on the part of the touch-stimulus
to break in upon the course of the number-judgment ordinarily
determined by the practical association of a specific group of
factors with number. That this result gets no more marked registration
in the percentages is apparently due to the strength of these
customary associations.</p>

<p>(5) The extent to which the distribution-error complicates the
present study is shown by the prompt increase in effectiveness of
the touch-stimulus when the groups were duplicated, as in C and D.</p>


<p>2. <em>The Influence of Hearing.</em></p>

<p>The scheme of the experimentation upon this factor conformed
in general to that of Section IV, 1. But a new sort of differentiation
was possible in the auditory field, and one more readily suggestive
of numerousness, perhaps, in that by use of an electric bell a rapid
succession of sounds could be given with one group while with the
other a single sound could be produced. An actual numerical difference
in the auditory field might fuse with the factor of relative visual
number and determine the judgment to its direction. These results<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
are set down in B of Table IX. The same set of cards was used in the
One-Group Apparatus for these experiments as for those of Section
IV, 1. In these two sections of Table IX the observers did not know
on which group the sound or the particular sound would be given;
but any possible disturbing effect of this irregularity was formally
eliminated as in Section IV, 1. The experiments of Table IX, C,
repeat those of A with duplication of groups; and D repeats those
of C with longer exposure.</p>

<p>The sound for A was that of a small organ-pipe (Ut 4) blown by
mouth. As in A of the preceding table the observers did not know
in a given experiment with which group the sound would be given,
but, as before, it was given the same number of times with the first
as with the last. For B the multiplied sound was produced by an
electric bell with a wooden gong. This was adopted in preference
to metal because of the prompt ceasing of the sound after the stroke,&mdash;a
very necessary condition when this sound accompanied the first
group, that it might be clearly connected with its own group. A
metal gong was used for the single sound, that the two might not be
too unequal in loudness. Its vibrations were deadened by a rubber
band, and each bell was controlled by a floor-button. For C and D
a higher sound, from the same pipe unstopped, was used in preference
to the former, for the reason that in certain experiments performed
just previously the lower sound had been used and was presumably
very familiar. So in order that the sound might be brought,
if possible, afresh to the attention, the change was made.</p>

<p>The results of these experiments may be summarized as follows:
(1) The figures give evidence of but two cases out of eleven where
sound was influential. (2) Duplication of groups is not effective in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
developing evidence of the influence of sound. (3) Increased length
of exposure works, as in former cases, to lessen the influence of the
modifying factor. (4) The introspections are to the effect that the
sound seems to be entirely without influence upon the judgment,
beyond the distraction it brings in the earlier stages of work. Sometimes
it dropped wholly out of consciousness. Sometimes the distraction
seemed to last longer. One observer reported, when D was taken,
that he felt as if the sound sometimes increased and sometimes decreased
the apparent numerousness. In some other experiments not
directly upon this point, but later to be reported, a sound was used;
and one observer reported that it seemed to become functionally
connected with certain gaps in the groups, as though the puff had
blown a hole in the group. Here its effect was of course to emphasize
negative factors. It appears thus that the sound might function
in opposite directions at different times, somewhat in accord with
the particular character of the visual presentation. We should expect,
then, to have percentages that look insignificant. (5) We shall
not have failed to notice the difference between touch and auditory
stimuli in the feeling of influence upon the number-judgment. If
we seek a cause for the superior influence of touch, we may perhaps
find it in the fact that practical experience has trained us to disregard
in any case of judgment such simultaneous presentations as
were employed for auditory stimuli; while a definite tap upon the
brow is a rather unusual experience likely to attract notice to itself
in spite of attempts at abstraction. As one observer said, who took
part in both kinds of experiments, the touch seemed more "intimate."</p>


<p>3. <em>The Influence of KinÃ¦sthetic Impression.</em></p>

<p>The method consisted in the employment of active effort upon a
fist dynamometer or a wooden handle during the appearance of one
of the groups. The handle was preferable because noiseless. The
effort was made with the left hand because the right was used in
recording. The amount of it was left to the observer's regulation,
with the one instruction that its presence be made decidedly evident
but without too great fatigue. The cards of Section IV 1 and 2 were
used in the One-Group Apparatus. Similarly again the experiments
were repeated with the duplicate-group cards. I present no table
here because the figures show practically no influence of the effort.
On one subject 176 experiments were made; on a second 132; on
a third 88.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note here certain results obtained from one observer
when he was in what he described as an active attitude toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
the groups, in which he seemed to rouse himself to an unusual pitch
of concentration upon the visual situation. This was evidently a condition
of increased effort to abstract. Without abstraction he gave
26 to 6 in favor of the effort while with abstraction this tendency had
fallen off to 30 to 17. The strength of the tendency is thus strongly
indicated. Another observer felt a kind of motor difference between
the groups; he expected the effort-group to look larger and felt additionally
excited, a scattered activity, while he was passive toward
the other group. Perhaps this account puts a little meaning into his
small per cent. That his power of abstraction was effective here is
hinted by his remark that he felt a difference in the groups even
when he judged them equal. The third observer found no subjective
evidence that effort modified his judgment.</p>

<p>Throughout the foregoing experiments has been involved the possibility
of some one of the three "errors" of experimentation, those
of time, space, and distribution, and sometimes all three. Their
effect on the results, if it existed, was, to be sure, eliminated in the
well-known way, but their existence, if actual, would raise an interesting
problem. It was possible, in the case of every group of experiments,
to rearrange the tables in such a way as to bring out the
evidence for any tendency to overestimate, for instance, the first
group as against the second, the right as against the left, or one
kind of irregular distribution as against another.</p>

<p>The distribution-error must have a word of explanation. It refers
to a tendency to give more wrong judgments in favor of one kind
of irregular distribution than of the other kind with which, in a
given card, it is mated. In the construction of a set of cards several
forms of irregular internal arrangement were used, in order that
the judgment might not be one merely of form, and of course on any
given card the forms were not the same. Elimination of the effect
of these form-differences from the results involved the appearance
of any given one as many times in connection with one of the two
contrasting factors studied in a given experiment as with the other.
Thus two sets of forms were carried through an experimental series&mdash;a
source of error indeed, but avoidable only by such means as
were used to escape the effects of the space-error. Analysis would
show which, if either, of the two sets received more judgments in
its favor, resulting in further evidence as to the extent to which the
judgment of relative number is a function of distribution, and as
to the fineness of discrimination for such differences.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span></p>

<p>Now the tables, when thus rearranged, show that these errors exist
to a surprisingly large extent. In many cases their causes, whatever
they are, seem to be the controlling factors in the judgment of relative
number.</p>

<p>Barring the experiments of Section III, in which the space-error
has largely been accounted for, I now propose to gather in one
survey all the results of those analyses that have given us the
information of the existence of these errors, and all the material of
later tables that bears on this point, and to test them by further
experimentation. I will begin with the space-error.</p>

<p>1. <em>The Space-Error.</em></p>

<p>Table X presents to us a summary of the values of the space-error
tendency. (1) Taken as a whole they fall into all the three
classes that are possible; (<em>a</em>) favoring right; (<em>b</em>) favoring left; (<em>c</em>)
no marked tendency. (2) There is no observer that does not at some
time show a fairly marked tendency. (3) All the observers fall into
(<em>c</em>) and all but five into both (<em>a</em>) and (<em>b</em>). (4) More favor the left
than the right,&mdash;50 to 35. (5) This survey makes it clear that the
observers agree neither with themselves nor with each other in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
direction of influence exerted by the causes underlying the space-error.</p>

<p><em>a. Special Experiments to establish the Facts.</em> It might be suspected
that irregularities would be more apparent where other factors
such as we have been studying enter to complicate the situation from
the point of view of pure relative position of the two groups. Table
XI presents the answer to this query. The cards used contained
groups of gray circles (Gray Darker, Prang) arranged in equal areas
of the usual size and shape. The distribution-error was eliminated,
though not by duplication, and the small-difference cards were retained.
The Two-Group Apparatus was used, with an exposure of
<span class="hfrac"><span class="numerator">6</span><span class="denominator">5</span></span> sec.</p>

<p>The results give us again our inevitable three classes, and in many
cases a difference-value surprisingly large when we reflect on the
simplicity of the conditions. That the omission of complicating
features was of importance is shown by the fact that more of the observers
(11 out of 14) show a marked error than in any other case.
Clearly enough the various factors introduced tend to eliminate the
space-error, but when in any case it does enter, it is even then capable
of rising to as high a degree on the whole as in the uncomplicated
series, as is shown by the fact that in but four cases does the new
value surpass the best of the old, and in three of these by a trifling
amount.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that the three cases of minimum space-error
show a well-defined tendency to be determined by distribution.</p>

<p><em>b. Possible Bases of this Error.</em> The outcome of these special experiments
is that the factors found in the groups are at least not directly
responsible for the situation that we are considering. The divergence
among the observers shows this. In hunting after the cause for this
apparent influence of side, we look first for changes in the peripheral,
and then in the central, processes that precede the judgment. The
material used for the experiments of Table XI seems approximately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
to have equalized all the objective factors in the two groups. How
could there be anything further in the peripheral process whereby
group could be differentiated from group? The most evident thing
is that the visual stimulus is received in a different way from the two
groups. There is a definite peripheral mechanism whose factors
seem essentially to be two, however variously they may be combined:
(<em>a</em>) The relative amount of time given to each group; (<em>b</em>) the
order in which the groups are viewed.</p>

<p>The observers were instructed and continually reminded to equalize
the amount of attention devoted to the group; but as this is not
wholly a voluntary matter, the possibility of failure to conform has
to be reckoned with. Experiment must therefore be employed to
test the influence of these factors before one can fall back upon a
central process as the cause for this tendency to favor a side.</p>

<p><em>c. Its Relation to Differences between the Groups in Length of Look.</em>
The material was the same used for the experiments of Table XI.
The method was the same with the following necessary exceptions:
The longer exposure was double the shorter (4/5 sec. to 2/5 sec.), and
2/5 sec. elapsed between the two. Further, the experiments were so
arranged as to equalize the influence of the order of exposure with
respect to both side and relative length. The means for effecting

<p>These facts are yielded by Table XII: (1) There are but two classes
of observers, as no tendency exists to favor the group of longer
exposure. (2) The time-error shows a considerably more marked
tendency than the length of look, which is indeed somewhat surpassed
by the space-error. (3) The persistence of the space-error, even
among those that reveal a tendency in length of exposure, shows
that the factor of relative difference in length of look cannot account
for it. The persistence of it, too, when the order of exposure is controlled,
even though the conditions are not wholly adapted to the
study of this latter factor, suggest at least that the space-error is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
independent of even that order; but into this we shall make
special enquiry. (4) The judgment of number is independent of the
amount of eye-movement devoted to the fixation of the objects in a
group. This conclusion, so far as the actual movement is concerned,
is established by the fact that so many observers favor the shorter
look; and by all the experiments with the One-Group Apparatus
where an exposure of 1/25 sec. was used, since that time was too
short to admit of movement. That ideated movement is likewise
insignificant appears from the fact of marked error arising in the
material where the groups were duplicates. Here no motives to different
movements could lie in the material.</p>

<p><em>d. Its Relation to the Order in which the Groups are viewed.</em> Table
XIII gives us the results of the enquiry. The experimental conditions
were not changed except as to the length of exposure. Each group
was given 3/5 sec.; and half the experiments were performed in the
order right-left and half in the reverse order.</p>

<p>The results may be thus summarized: (1) The order of exposure is
notably influential upon the judgment of relative number, giving
the usual three classes, with the tendency to overestimate the last
group well in the lead. (2) The persistence of the space-error under
these relatively simple conditions shows conclusively that it is not
a function of the order of exposure. The two are independent variables.</p>

<p>2. <em>The Time-Error.</em></p>

<p>In pursuit of our enquiry we must survey the facts as they are given
in the various experiments already reported and later to be reported.
These facts are gathered into Table XIV, which furnishes the following
items of significance: (1) All the observers, with the exception
of Rouse, show at some time a definite tendency. One case only is
given for him in this table, but other experiments not included in
the tables from which the present is drawn confirm this fact by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
ratio 29 to 30. (2) There is a rather striking consistency in the several
observers. (3) The predominance of the last group is marked.</p>

<p><em>a. Relation of the Error to the Absolute Length of the Total Exposure.</em>
Table XV is set to answer this question. It is unsatisfactory in that
but two observers took part in both XIII and XV. The material
used for judgment consisted of the same cards used in the earlier
experiment, but presented now in the One-Group Apparatus. The
time of exposure was changed from 3/5 sec. to 1/25 sec. for each group.
As the space-error was eliminated, the tendency to a time-error, if
present at all, would presumably have freer play.</p>

<p>But the difference-values of the new table are for the most part
very small. We have thus the further fact about the time-error that,
under the conditions studied, it appears to be independent of the
absolute length of exposure, when the groups are equal in this respect.
To this we may add another fact drawn from Table XIV,
that with the One-Group Apparatus the time-error is greater on the
whole where the groups are differentiated by other factors. Thirdly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
the values for Table XIII show that with all complicating factors
withdrawn, except the differences in position, the error is at a maximum.
This may be significant of the effect of space-differences upon
that error, or, more probably, be due to the general difference between
work by daylight and work in a dark room by artificial light.
We shall be better able to consider this later.</p>

<p>3. <em>The Distribution-Error.</em></p>

<p>The last of our three "errors" of experimentation is now before
us. We may recall once more the meaning the term has had for us
in these studies. It points to a tendency discovered by the use of
those cards where all objective factors were in the course of a series
equalized,&mdash;a tendency to mass one's judgments in favor of a particular
arrangement of the circles; though each group had been constructed
with a view to filling the given area as homogeneously as an
irregular arrangement would allow.</p>

<p>As in the two "errors" preceding, so here we must get possession
of the facts that gave rise to the present enquiry. Table XVI presents
them to us, gathered out of all the tables wherein such a tendency
has been technically reckoned with. But first a few words of explanation
are needed to make the new table intelligible. Two sets of
results are found in its two parts. In each set the particular group-arrangements
employed and the frequency of their appearance are
exactly the same. The two sets differ, as their headings suggest, in
that the material for the second set was formed out of the first by
replacing the small-difference cards by those having equal groups.
Such a change as this might affect the proportion of judgments given
in favor of the two sets of arrangements in a particular series, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
these new results are, therefore, no longer fully comparable with
the earlier ones. In presenting the directions of tendency in the
results, it is impossible here, as in all the similar cases throughout
the tables, to name a factor as a standard in whose favor all the
judgments in the plus column should be understood as given,&mdash;impossible
for this reason that, because the very method by which
the circles were distributed in the groups, the experimenter was unable
to satisfy himself as to the significant differences in the arrangements.
All the results, however, when analyzed on this basis, were
recorded consistently, so that consistencies and agreements among
the observers might be readily apparent. We can now understand
in part what Table XVI has to say to us.</p>

<blockquote><p>Here as elsewhere the per cents recorded indicate the average per cent of difference
in favor of a given class.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here are the facts, first of A: (1) The only lapses from consistency
are confined to two observers; and in both these cases there
is but a single break in a uniform trend. (2) With three exceptions
all agree in the trend of their difference-values. Of these three&mdash;Holt,
Hylan, and Moore&mdash;the last furnishes but one significant
value, and so must be left out of the reckoning on this point. (3) Of
the 64 cases, 50 rise above 10%, some far beyond, showing the
importance for the judgment of relative number of this factor of
distribution. (4) Of the 50 cases, 45 agree in tendency. (5) That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
with this surprising agreement we have still a few exceptions, adds
another item to the growing array of evidence on behalf of the importance
of some subjective factor for the number-judgment. As to the
nature of this factor we are yet in the dark. (6) To these facts B
of this same table adds the further information that the observers
inconsistent in the old are not consistent in the new, while the
consistent still maintain their record.</p>

<p><em>a. Analysis of the Experimental Conditions of Distribution.</em> At
once we are interested to enquire for the factors underlying these
results. To put ourselves upon the right track we must first consider
what factors are involved in any such arrangement of objects as we
have used in the material for these studies, and then, more precisely,
we may ask in what way such arrangements could differ
significantly. Finally, by an experimental trial-and-error process,
we may solve our problem.</p>

<p>The groups of objects in our material were arranged in an area
marked out in each corner by a circle. Within this area the circles
were set irregularly, with the result that the group, as a mass of
objects distinguished from a homogeneous background, had a more
or less irregular outline whose irregularity varied with different internal
arrangements. Within its outlines this area presented a mixed
pattern of bright and dark. While the total enclosure marked off
by the corner circles was always the same and theoretically the relative
amounts of brightness and darkness in equal groups was likewise
the same, yet practically differences, more or less slight, might
enter through the changing character of the rude outlines whose
ideal completeness could scarcely be brought out of a black background
by the uninitiated. The amount of this difference is sometimes
surprising to one whose chief thought of the group has been
as vignetted in process of construction. As the objects are pushed
toward the edges the central spaces open out; as they are withdrawn
toward the interior gaps appear in the margin.</p>

<p>It is not a very easy task to fill an area with objects in irregular
arrangement in such a way that no sections of vacancy or filling
stand out by contrast against the remainder of the same element.
To succeed in this is to fill the area homogeneously. But the chances
are good that some vacant patch will get slightly the better of its
neighbors or some section of circles will gather a little more closely
than the surrounding circles; or perhaps a gap in the outline will be
unexpectedly intrusive. Now in a given area the circles of one part
cannot become more thickly massed without a corresponding enlargement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
of the vacancies of the other parts, and of course the converse
is as true; but this theoretical situation may be quite out of ken at
the moment when the group is seen. Either member of this pair of
complements may stand out vividly in the field and its fellow quite
escape perception. The very nicety with which in practical affairs
we have to make a reliable comparison of this sort shows what suspicion
of accuracy the off-hand judgment has bred. And further,
the widening of a gap or thickening of the filling in one small part
of a group may give a complementary loss to the rest of the group
small enough to be unperceived when distributed throughout the
larger section.</p>

<p>Two factors must therefore be considered as possibly significant
in moving the judgment,&mdash;vacancies and filling; and with the former
must be reckoned indrawing of the outline. Psychologically, increase
in the prominence of either of these factors would be all one
with their objective increase. With respect to the direction of their
influence upon the judgment of number the increase of vacancies
must signify the waning, and the increase of filling the waxing, of
the objective number in the group.</p>

<p>It is in advance altogether probable that the results gathered
into Table XVI were brought about by these two factors, at least in
large part. And we have also in these factors the possibility of two
types; for as we saw above, increased vacancies in one part involves
increase of filling in another, and conversely. So the interesting
question turns upon the altogether disproportional representation of
types. Which is the type of the majority?</p>

<p><em>b. Experimental Test of Hypotheses.</em> The question was put to
the test of experiment. This was done by using groups in which now
vacancies and now filling were objectively emphasized in contrast
with the usual homogeneous group. First the vacancies. A set of
cards was prepared after the method previously used to eliminate the
distribution-error without duplication of groups on any one card.
(See Section II.) In the present case, however, the two sets of
arrangements were definitely differentiated as already indicated.
One set had a homogeneously filled area, the other a prominent
vacancy within or gap in the edge. The size of these variations was
kept pretty close to the limit of noticeableness, that the increase in
compactness of the other portions might be as slight as possible. It
was experimentally necessary to free the material as far as might
be from ambiguity, and practically important to avoid rousing the
suspicions of the observers and the resulting reflections. It seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
very likely that the strength of the tendency shown by the distribution-error
was due to its appearance in situations where the observers
knew that other factors were being tested.</p>

<p>The general method already described was used in preparing the
groups that gave objective prominence to compacted parts of the
filling. To fulfil the conditions outlined above was here even more
difficult than in the first set; and the cause will appear in the sequel.
The small-difference cards were omitted and the One-Group Apparatus
used.</p>

<p>A further attempt was made to head off reflection by a subterfuge.
It had been found that, among the factors whose influence on the
judgment had been studied, hearing had been as little effective as
any. So the small stopped pipe used for those experiments was again
brought into service and the error resulting eliminated in the usual
way. Incidentally our new tables will thus give us further information
about the effect of this factor, though of course under conditions
that are theoretically highly unfavorable, since we are forcing
upon the attention of the observers other factors that experience
has shown them only too ready to seize upon. So if a tendency traceable
to the factor of hearing should appear, we ought perhaps to give it
somewhat more than its face value.</p>

<p>Now we are ready to inspect the results. Table XVII, A is the outcome
of the attempt to emphasize vacancies. Its experiments with
<span class="hfrac"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">25</span></span> sec. exposure were repeated with one of <span class="hfrac"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">4</span></span> sec. as Table XVII,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
B, shows. In Table XVII, C, the emphasis of compactness is concerned.</p>

<p>For convenience we may again resort to a summary outline in
extracting the meaning from these tables. First Table XVII, A.
(1) All the observers but one agree in favoring the homogeneous, most
of them with very high difference-values. (2) Miller alone gives no
tendency, and his notes show a conflict between the increased vacancy
and the increased compactness. In other words, his discrimination
was too keen for the material. Under the circumstances he
constitutes no exception to the conclusion that the vacancy objectively
emphasized was the cause for an underestimation of its group.</p>

<p>From Table XVII, B, we learn the following: (1) All the observers
save one favor the homogeneous group, in most cases by large values.
(2) The difference in the length of exposure seems to have no significance
for this tendency, since, while Holt and Shaw decline, Miller
rises in the scale.</p>

<p>Table XVII, C, gives us these facts: (1) The difference-values have
noticeably fallen off. (2) We have again the customary three classes,
but with homogeneous leading as in the earlier tables. (3) By his
present favoring of the compact, Miller has now appeared in all
three classes, while Holt has developed the preference for the compact
that was budding in XVII, B. (4) The presence of four well-marked
preferences for the homogeneous shows that the vacancies in
the compact group were more significant for the number-judgment
than was the increased compactness of the filling, and that in spite
of the experimental effort to the contrary. (5) The decrease of this
tendency and the growth of the opposing, indicates that the judgment
is determined in either case by the more vivid factor.</p>

<p>The conclusions to be drawn from these facts lie close at hand.
(<em>a</em>) The results in Table XVI, with their disproportionate division into
classes, were evidently due to the tendency of three observers to note
the filling and of the rest to be concerned with the vacancies. (<em>b</em>)
The judgment of relative number under these conditions is primarily
a judgment of vacancies. (<em>c</em>) The subjective factor of vividness
determines the direction of error, and may attach to either vacancies
or filling, though it usually attaches to the former.</p>

<p>It may not be out of place here to speculate a bit as to the probable
cause for so close a dependence of the number-judgment upon
what has no number, so to say; upon an object that has no standing
in the official conclusion. The situation seems to be fundamentally
based upon the conditions that determine contrast. In a homogeneous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
field no part stands out. Introduce a small object quite different
in brightness or complementary in color and the attention is drawn
instantly to it, but internal differences in its content are quite lost
in the common quality by which it differs from the ground. A case
somewhat analogous is furnished by our material, particularly in
the One- and Two-Group Apparatus. The small group is so unified
by its contrast with the field that internal differences must be made
out with relative effort. Now internal differences are necessary to
the numerical character demanded of it, and they can be brought
out in no way save by attending to the vacancies and so isolating
parts in the threatening unity, each in a kind of space-matrix. The
most careful observer could not do better on his way to truth; and
that is why the error was so much larger when the factor of space-differences
was studied.</p>

<p>That group is normally the more numerous in which the vacancies
are less completely developed under observation. We say "normally"
here by virtue of the speculation just completed as to the best method
of attaining a judgment objectively true. For a man thus proceeding,
our proposition is a sound statement of fact, to which the following
results of our experiments bear witness. (<em>a</em>) The experiments
recorded in Table XII on Relative Difference in Length of
Look shows no exception of a value equal to 10% to the general
statement that all tendencies, when any existed, were in the direction
of favoring the shorter group. The shorter the time of exposure the
less completely would the vacancies develop. (<em>b</em>) Table IV, E, shows
that without exception the darker group tends to be judged the more
numerous. (<em>c</em>) Table XXI shows for each subject that in a shorter
exposure the absolute number seems considerably greater than in a
longer exposure.</p>

<p>No comment seems necessary to concentrate the force of such
evidence. If we carry our proposition to the detailed results of our
separate studies in factors of distribution, we shall find that it helps
us to understand those few exceptions to the general trend of observers
as they appear in Tables II and XVII. The exceptions there
favored the groups in which compactness of parts went along with
certain large vacancies. Possibly enough they refused to fall in with
the objective analysis, and, disregarding the prominent vacancies,
devoted themselves to a development of the vacancies within the
compacted parts.</p>

<p><em>c. The Factor of Hearing.</em> The time-error analyses of the experiments
of Table XVII have already contributed their facts to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
special section dealing with that error. But one or two interesting
facts have remained unnoticed in the sound-analysis. In the experiments
of Table XVII, A, there is a single case of marked tendency to
favor the sound group. With the lengthened exposure of B, this
tendency, as usual, disappears; but returns in C to some extent and
two other observers share it. A fourth markedly favors the group
without sound. So the experiments of this last table present as
marked external evidence as we have for the influence of hearing
upon the judgment. These facts are presented in Table XVIII.</p>

<p>It is a further curious fact, well sustained by these same experiments,
that where there is some confusion, each of the factors present
has a better chance to determine the judgment. The values for both
time-error and sound rise higher for the majority in C than in A
or B.</p>

<p>The nature of the enquiry that we have been pursuing through
so many pages is such that it may be raised exactly as well in the
case of absolute as in that of relative number. There appears to be
no reason why in this new field the results should not be exactly
comparable with those in the old, to be taken indeed as a kind of
test for the interpretation to be put upon the old. Without a single
exception, unless it were imposed by a technical difficulty, all the
earlier factors could be studied with the new purpose. Our practical
interest to go to such lengths would depend pretty largely upon
the results of first attempts. If wholly confirmatory, these would
probably suffice.</p>

<p>The experimental conditions were of the simplest. The 3-8 in.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
steel balls of Section III were again pressed into service as objects
for the number-judgment. They were thrown loosely into a fixed
black frame, 20 cm. square. To avoid suggestive noises, its undersurface
was made of a thick piece of felt covered with black cloth;
and the whole rested of course on a black-topped table. The exposures
were 2 sec. long, timed by watch-ticks. Between experiments
the observer held a cardboard screen between him and the objects.
When conditions were ready for a new judgment, closing his eyes
he lowered the screen, opening his eyes again at the word of command
and shutting them at the close of the experiment.</p>

<p>Of course the observers felt that their judgments were for the
most part extremely vague. With small numbers they had a greater
feeling of confidence. Yet altogether it was surprising with what
readiness an absolute number-judgment would spring up in the
presence of any given collection whatever within the limits set by
the experimental series. Sometimes the observers thought that
they made rough calculations on the basis of the filling in a unit of
area. So far as this held it would tend to cut off the more astonishing
departures from correctness, and it would probably advantage
the smaller groups more than the large. Still it was entirely too
rough a method to prevent the influence of the factors introduced,
as the results will show. There was no time for systematic counting,
which, in any case, the observers knew to be forbidden.</p>

<p>The figures in which the observers reported their judgments of
absolute number have a value that is chiefly qualitative. The marked
inconsistencies and disagreements are our guarantee for this statement.
With all the observers there was but the loosest association
between group-appearance and number-name. The innumerable variations
in internal space-relations were of course responsible. For one
observer a particular name probably had a quantitative significance
far in excess of its value for another observer in this respect. To
one man 100 might have meant about the same as 60, for example,
to his neighbor. On the whole they were parsimonious; but Baldwin
decidedly not.</p>

<p>A more or less constant influence was exerted on any given judgment
by the comparison of the presented group with the traces of
the preceding still in mind. The observers felt, however, that the
judgment was largely independent of such comparison, and its fluctuations
give some credence to this feeling.</p>

<p>The numbers chosen ranged by fives, from 25 to 100. In four
cases a number was immediately repeated that rough suggestions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
as to the definiteness of the judgment and its dependence upon the
actual number might be gained. These were indeed but rough
suggestions, since, with certain exceptions to be noticed later, the
arrangement was disturbed between times; but they made possible
a closer watch upon the flickering of the judgment than could be
kept by a mere repetition of the series. In the latter case it might
be unstable and yet relatively firm in the other. A standard series
is here recorded. Its order was determined by drawing the numbers
out of a heap, but the repetitions were inserted arbitrarily.</p>

<p>1. <em>Absolute Number under Standard Conditions.</em></p>

<p>An indispensable preliminary for the present study is the establishment
of a standard. Unless we know something in advance
about the characteristics of the judgment of absolute number in
relatively simple conditions, we shall be unable to tell what influence,
if any, to attribute to the modifying factor in later experiments.
Having then decided as to the general conditions under which we will
study the problem we must make these the standard conditions of
our work; and having discovered the nature of the judgments given
under them, measure up to these results in all that is to follow. These
standard conditions have already been set forth in the introduction
to this section. The results are recorded in Tables XIX and XX.</p>

<p>Turning to these tables we notice at once, as characteristic of all
the observers, the following facts: (1) Wide variation from objective
correctness. (2) A far wider discrepancy with the larger
numbers than with the smaller. Miller does not wholly agree here.
His judgments by series show inconstancy, tending at first to follow
the rule, but in the last two series to a maximum error near the
middle. Certain remarks of this observer suggest that possibly in
the latter case reflection as to the convenience of certain actual
numbers for manipulation may have had influence. The three earlier
series of Hutchison conform to the rule. The remainder, on
the contrary, show no definite progression in tendency. It should
be noted here that both Miller and Hutchison were more inclined
than the other two observers to rough calculation. The effect of
its adoption or of increased practice in it is shown by the disappearance
of the characteristics of the earlier series. We have thus in these
two cases a doubleness of standard that we must not fail to consider
in our later comparisons. (3) There is a pronounced instability of
judgment, as shown by the fluctuations for the same number in
different series, and especially in successive judgments, of the same
in any given series. (4) There is a general tendency to judge in
multiples of five. That there should be any splitting of fives, particularly
in the large numbers, might be regarded as mere caprice.
Not so did it seem to the observers. They were conscious of an
apparent absurdity in it where judgments were necessarily so vague;
but they insisted that this stood for a kind of qualitative shading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
in the perception which threw out the choice of the round numbers
just above and below. (5) The number is on the whole underestimated,
three observers agreeing in this respect; but the fourth shows
a very large and consistent tendency in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>In spite of the manifold special inconstancies and disagreements,
these general tendencies are decidedly well-featured in the results.
We may say that we have found a kind of standard illusion that
will serve us for a guide through our later studies.</p>

<p>The first of the modifying factors to be considered has to do with
the arrangement of the objects. Hitherto they had been thrown loosely
into the frame. Now in successive studies they were, first, well
scattered over the surface and, second, brought together into several
compact nuclei. The last arrangement was adopted in preference
to that of a single mass as being less open to comparison with preceding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
judgments and to judgment on the basis of form and size of
group.</p>

<p>The results are shown in Table XIX: (1) The effect of scattering
the objects is very markedly to raise the apparent number. Baldwin's
preceding overestimations soar still higher; while Miller's
former tendency to underestimation is checked to such an extent
that 13 overestimations appear. (2) The effect of compacting the
objects is just as markedly in the opposite direction. Baldwin gives
31 underestimations, and Miller reverts in a measure to his former
type. (3) When similar arrangements were up for study in relative
number we found two classes of observers, one favoring the compact,
the other the scattered. The present results of Baldwin and
Miller put them into the latter class.</p>

<p>3. <em>The Influence of Complexity of Group-Content.</em></p>

<p>This new factor of complexity in the content of the group was
realized experimentally by making up the collection out of steel
balls of two sizes, 1/8 in. and 3/8 in. The former looked almost infinitesimal
beside the latter. The same objective numbers were
still maintained and divided between the two sizes except where in
so doing a five must be broken. In such a case the extra five went to
the larger balls.</p>

<p>The results are found in Table XX. Olmsted shows no definite
influence of the new factor. Hutchison, however, shows a very evident
decrease in his estimations, when comparison is made with his
second standard series. With the earlier series the new results rather
closely correspond. That the latter are not simply a vacillating reversion
seems fairly clear from this observer's account of his method.
The small balls, he says, did not distinctly come in visually. To his
judgment of the large he added an amount based on a very insecure
estimate of the small. The number of the latter seemed from time
to time pretty constant.</p>

<p>This situation corresponds very fully to that in the investigation
of the same factor by use of a group of mixed colors, where relative
number was in question. (Section II.) The tendency there discovered
was to neglect the other colors in favor of one which thus surpassed
the others in vividness. There as here the mixed group seemed
smaller.</p>

<p>4. <em>The Influence of Size of Objects.</em></p>

<p>A study of this factor was made possible by substituting for the
usual objects steel balls of a smaller size, 1-4 in. The results are
contained in Table XX. They are not so striking as those obtained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
in our study of distribution. Still the influence of this new factor is
evident, in the reduction of the apparent number. Olmsted shows
this more generally for the smaller numbers. We find it in Hutchison
when we compare the new results with the second standard
series. This tendency to underestimation increases in the two final
series of the present set. At the beginning of these two he remarked
that he thought he had been overestimating the group. This tendency
of smaller size to reduce apparent number was found true for
the majority of observers in our earlier study of relative number.</p>

<p>5. <em>The Influence of the Length of Exposure.</em></p>

<p>I found that in relative number the shorter the look the more
marked was the influence of certain factors. Reports of the observers
making this seem highly probable happened in this way:
When working with the One-Group Apparatus in relative number
the shutter of the camera would occasionally stick, leaving a group
exposed beyond its usual time. The effect of this upon some but
not all the observers was to cause a noticeable shrinking in numerousness.
Of those questioned, the only one failing to notice this effect
is included among the observers in this new study.</p>

<p>To test this possibility resort was had to the One-Group Apparatus
as affording a more satisfactory means for getting different lengths
of exposure of small absolute magnitude. Cards were prepared containing
a single group of larger area (67 Ã 82 mm.) than had been
used for relative number. The objects were the usual white circles.
Each corner was marked as usual; and, by reason of the number
involved, the outline of the area was more regular than had been
true in the earlier work. The number of circles on each card varied
by steps of two from 16 to 30, giving eight cards in all. The series
was arranged irregularly as before, and two of the cards repeated
immediately upon their first presentation, making ten experiments
in one set. The order of the series follows:</p>

<ul class="index">
<li>1. 24</li>
<li>2. 22</li>
<li>3. 26</li>
<li>4. No change</li>
<li>5. 18</li>
<li>6. 28</li>
<li>7. 16</li>
<li>8. 20</li>
<li>9. 30</li>
<li>10. No change</li>
</ul>


<p>Two time-magnitudes were used for comparison,&mdash;1-25 sec.
and 1 sec. The latter was managed with bulb exposure. All the
experiments with the shorter time were made before those with the
longer had been begun. The results are given in Table XXI. So far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
as the material is comparable, we may include in our comparison
the standard experiments of Tables XIX and XX with 2 sec.
exposure.</p>

<p class="center">For the meaning of these figures see note under Table XIX.</p>

<p>The outcome may be thus summarized: (1) The apparent number
is inversely proportional to the length of exposure. The tables
show a perfectly clear progression from 2 sec. to 1-25 sec. All those
that formerly underestimated are brought into the opposite class.
(2) The results of the earlier experiments are confirmed on the whole
with respect to the occurrence of greater errors with the larger numbers.
(3) Baldwin's overestimation reaches astonishing heights. (4)
These new facts for absolute number are quite in accord with Table
XII, where, under the conditions of interpretation laid down, the
tendencies were wholly in favor of the shorter look.</p>

<p>The issue of these tentative experiments in absolute number confirms
the teaching of our studies in the related field. Absolute number,
like relative, has been found largely subject to a modifying
influence of certain factors. In the new field, too, distribution has
asserted its supremacy among these, and similar effects of shortening
exposure have been observed. There has been variation among the
observers and some shifting of tendency, both of which point as before
to the coÃ¶peration of some subjective factor in our results. Indeed
the whole situation, as opened by these preliminary studies, indicates
a theoretical interpretation that for both fields is at bottom one. So to
an attempt to reach such an interpretation the next section will be
devoted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span></p>


<p class="p2b">VII. T<span class="smcapa">HEORETICAL</span> D<span class="smcapa">ISCUSSION</span></p>

<p>1. <em>The Fact of Modification.</em></p>

<p>That such an influence upon the judgment of number should have
been exercised by the factors considered seems in many cases to
receive an adequate account on the principle of association. Our
practical experience in the simultaneous variability of number and
certain other characteristics of a group of objects has been such as
to lead us into illusions when the two no longer vary together. In
such a case, when we have no time to count, we are actually led to
<em>see</em> a group as smaller or larger in accordance with the variations
perceived in the associated factor. This interpretation is supported
by the fact that on the whole the space-factors were more markedly
influential in creating illusions than were any others. For those
cases, however, in which the modification was effected by a factor
unconnected with number, as color, or the simultaneous stimulation
of other senses by irrelevant objects, it appears that the mere
occurrence of greater total stimulation during the appearance of
one group is sufficient to create illusion, either through failure of the
observer to discriminate between the relevant and the irrelevant,
or because he is led through fear of disturbance to overemphasize
the other group.</p>

<p>2. <em>The Direction of Modification.</em></p>

<p>The foregoing account of the general fact throws no light upon
the <em>direction</em> of the influence. Why should a given factor make a
group seem more numerous and not less? Why should it affect one
man in one way and his neighbor in another? Why should it vary
with the same man at different times? Appearances no less contradictory
than these are what we must face in carrying a theoretical
account to completion. The following propositions with appended
commentary are offered in satisfaction of these requirements.</p>

<p><em>a.</em> Differences in vividness among the factors determine differences
in number.</p>

<p>Our study of the factor of distribution in Table XVII, where it was
possible in a measure to control the vividness, furnishes evidence
for this proposition. Introspective reports in other cases confirm
this view by showing that the direction of the attention, the popular
way of stating our proposition, was the determining feature. This
will receive further support in our discussion of the following proposition.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> If the vivid factor or complex be positive, <em>i. e.</em>, associated in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
experience with the numerous, or if it be neutral, its group will
seem the more numerous. If negative, <em>i. e.</em>, associated in experience
with the few, its group will seem the less numerous.</p>

<p>The experiments upon the effect of distribution support this
proposition, especially as set out in Table XVII. When the vacancies
in a given group were made vivid, the other group seemed more
numerous; when its filling surpassed in vividness, the judgment
was given for it. We have other confirmation in the fact that lengthening
the time of exposure reduced the absolute number. Take also
this note of one observer on the material in Table II, C:</p>

<p>"I noticed that I had set the open spaces in the outlined group
over against the lack of them in the homogeneous, without paying
much attention to the nearness together of the spots in the lines of
the outlined. Then for a time my attitude was quite vacillating. I
found my attention drawn to the nearness together of the spots in
part of the outlined group so strongly that if I did not turn it voluntarily
to the fact that the other was filled without any large open
spaces, I was led to call almost any outlined group the larger. Toward
the end of the experiment I got back into my original attitude, in
which the outlined group seemed to have its spots hardly more
thickly arranged in any part than the homogeneous, and to have
also the bare spots and so to be the fewer."</p>

<p>That the vividness of a neutral factor or complex increases the
apparent number was suggested by comments of the observers. One
observer reported of the material in Table IV: "The greater brightness
of red gave it more importance. The natural thing seemed to
be to give the red the judgment. The gray fought more for recognition."
And again: "The red seems a vitalized space and the dots
more omnipresent, also the red lasts longer in memory and is there
more vivid, so that often in cases of doubt, where the decisive comparison
was made in memory, the red may have been given the vote.
Often there was an immediate unanalyzed feeling that if the groups
had been both of the same color, the judgment would have been for
the gray." In both cases his results showed this tendency. Another
observer, whose results agree with the former, found that his eye was
directed involuntarily toward the red.</p>

<p>This fact was put to a special test. In the material of Table II, B, a
card, in which the pattern group had an appearance strikingly different
from the normal, was introduced, the two groups being objectively
equal. With three observers the effect was overestimation of this
group, and with a fourth, the suppression to equality of a previous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
overestimation of the opposite group. This fact, together with the
observers' comments, seems to justify the conclusion that the vividness
of a neutral factor or complex was the determining condition
of the judgment. That the observers did not all show positive results
in this experiment may be set down to the difficulty in controlling
the subjective conditions of vividness. Of course the space-relations
within the new pattern were different from those in the old.
The only justification for taking no account of these is the character
of the introspections themselves.</p>

<p>It should be said of the red group that beside its vividness it had
characters mentioned by other observers that might independently
have made its number seem greater. It was called "dazzling,"
"blurred," and its area seemed increased. In this respect the effect
of the color should be discussed as a special case of distribution or
object-size.</p>

<p>The vividness tested in this special way seems due to contrast,
in the one case with surroundings, in the other case with the expected.
Such a judgment is very far removed from the normal bases,
rather more so, it would seem, than even those where a group had
sound or touch accompaniment; for in the latter case there could
be no question about the "moreness"; the only doubt could be about
its legitimacy. Of the precise extent to which this cause of vividness
has operated throughout our studies, even where spatial differences
have been concerned, we cannot be sure. The patterns of the materials
in B and C of Table II seem to offer that possibility. That it
should enter anywhere opens, indeed, the entire field.</p>

<p><em>c.</em> The observers fall into the following classes on the basis of the
character of the association:</p>

<p>(1) Relatively fixed association,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(<em>a</em>) involving correct adjustment to objects (vividness of relevant
factors);</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) involving incorrect adjustment to objects (vividness of
irrelevant factors).</p></blockquote>

<p>(2) Relatively unstable association.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that in the case of nearly every factor
studied under Relative Number, we found three classes of observers,&mdash;those
favoring one group, those favoring the other group, and
a so-called "no-tendency" class. The bases of classification were,
first, the relative constancy in the character of the error, and, secondly,
its direction. In this third or "no-tendency" class were really lumped
off two kinds of observers, not separated at the time because our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
special interest did not demand it. Along with those that gave large
errors in both directions was a much smaller class that gave a relatively
large proportion of correct judgments; but could never claim
any one observer all the time. In the new classification of Proposition
<em>c</em> this mixed composition is recognized by dividing it between (1)
(<em>a</em>) and (2). The prime condition of correct judgment is asserted to
be one in principle with that of the illusion,&mdash;namely, vividness, but
in this case vividness of relevant factors. Our original "tendency"
classes both fall under (1) (<em>b</em>).</p>

<p>Proposition <em>c</em> is merely an attempt to apply the principles of association
and vividness to an organization of our results. The types
in question have no hard-and-fast connection with any particular
observer; they rather represent a kind of ideal fixation of opposite
tendencies playing through all.</p>

<p>3. <em>The Time-Error.</em></p>

<p>So far the time-error has been left without interpretation. The chief
facts to be considered were: (<em>a</em>) Divergence of error and general
trend in favor of last. (<em>b</em>) Individual inconsistencies. (<em>c</em>) Occasional
absence.</p>

<p>We are in a position now to invoke at once the principle of vividness
to account for the existence of the error and the vividness of
recency to account for the predominant tendency to favor the last
of the two groups exposed. In this respect this error may be classed
with the effect of red. That is to say, a factor or complex, directly
through its vividness and not indirectly through its association with
the numerous or the few, draws the judgment after it. Here the content
of the group is the effective thing, not the character of the vacancies.</p>

<p>But the observers do not all agree in the direction of the time-error
nor are they always consistent. Here we shall get help from a proposition
offered in the discussion of the distribution-error in which
it is asserted that the group seems the more numerous in which the
vacancies are less developed under observation. We have already
noted a decided tendency to depend in judging upon the vacancies.
Let us suppose that the two groups presented in succession differ
with respect to the success of the observer in developing these vacancies.
If this be true, that difference may well depend upon the
occurrence of maximal attention during the exposure of but one of
the groups. The tendency of the majority to overestimate the second
group suggests that the attention is likely to be at a maximum when
the experiment begins. If, on the other hand, it ripen later, or if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
the observer seek to rescue the second group from relative unclearness,
then we should have the first group overestimated. The time-error
would disappear for those that could attend alike to both.
Clearly enough this account is decidedly hypothetical.</p>

<p>4. <em>The Space-Error.</em></p>

<p>Our attempt to reduce this error to one of time in some form was
proven a failure. The facts brought out indicate that at the bottom
is some subjective factor thus far not isolated. This factor is not
a preference going directly with right- or left-handedness because on
the surface at least it runs in the observers independent of such
asymmetry. A single bit of available introspection would seem, however,
to point to some relation of that sort; for one observer, who
favored the left, felt that a group on that side gained an importance
that was somehow due to the greater absolute value of a weight in
the left than in the right hand. Even if this be decisive for him it
will still be inapplicable to errors in the opposite direction unless
we assume that with variations in bodily energy the emphasis is cast
now in one, now in the other, direction, after the analogy of those
two types of man to be found in our social experience, for whom
respectively mountains are molehills and molehills mountains. Such
successive differences in type in a single individual would then find
an intelligible account in the shifting tides of that bodily energy.
It is to be noted that the observer just quoted once, but only once,
made a decisive reversal of his error from left to right.</p>

<p>It may occur to some one that the use of two observers sitting side
by side may have given them a preference for one position of the
groups. In the first place care was taken that both groups should
be as readily seen from one point of view as from the other. Secondly
and chiefly, there is no regularity among the observers in this respect.</p>

<p>It is not unlikely that a chance aspect of a particular group develops
an emphasis that gives the mechanism of subjective adjustment
a particular bent that for a time is relatively independent of the objective
situation. Still the fact that there are some cases of persistence
in type is rather damaging to this assumption and speaks rather
for the earlier one. That one, if true, seems indeed adequate to
account for the situation. As an hypothesis it accords with analogous
physiological facts; but its weakness lies in imposing the burden
of a strong tendency upon asymmetrical differences that may be
in comparison relatively slight. Finally, these studies furnish no
proof that the bodily condition of an observer of a particular type
corresponds to the demands of the hypothesis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Summary</em>: 1. The estimation of relative number in the visual field
is modified by group-area, internal distribution, order, and complexity
in group-composition; by the size, form, color, brightness,
and complexity of the individual members; and by the character
of the environment. It is further modified by factors contributed
by the objects through other senses, as in active pressure, special
differences in pressure character, active weight, and that complex
of muscular and spatial factors arising when a group is observed
under the condition of eye-muscle strain. The judgment is also
influenced by factors outside the group in the field of touch, but not
in that of kinÃ¦sthetic impressions.</p>

<p>2. On the whole the most influential factors were those lying in
the space-characters of the groups; while those of least moment
were contributed by other objects in other fields of sensation. Hearing
was very nearly ineffectual.</p>

<p>3. In very many cases the observers fell into three groups, one
of no-tendency, and a second and third showing opposite tendencies
with respect to the factor investigated.</p>

<p>4. With a majority of observers there is a tendency to underestimation
in the judgment of absolute number, though with a single
observer the tendency is directly the reverse. Scattering the objects
increases, and compacting diminishes, the apparent number. The
smaller the size of the objects the fewer, under conditions, do they
appear; while heterogeneity in group-composition lessens the number
for one observer and has no apparent effect upon the other.</p>

<p>5. The apparent absolute number of objects is inversely proportional
to the length of exposure of a group; and in relative number
the influence of a factor was on the whole greater for shorter exposures.</p>

<p>6. The marked tendency to a space-error was found to be independent
of differences between the groups in the length of look, and
of the order in which they were viewed.</p>

<p>7. The distribution-error is grounded in a fundamental tendency
to base the judgment of relative number upon the character of the
vacancies in a group; though a secondary tendency to depend upon
the filling was shown to exist. The subjective factor of vividness,
attaching now to one and now to the other of the foregoing factors,
determines which shall be operative, though it usually is joined to
the first. The ground for the primary tendency may very well be
the necessities imposed upon discrimination by the material. The
contrast effect between the large black background and the brighter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
objects tends to unify the latter, which, to be discriminated as a number,
must be split up by an emphasis of the vacancies.</p>

<p>8. The time-error is possibly due to differences in power to dismember
the groups exposed in succession in one experiment, while
its variations in direction seem adequately accounted for by differences
in the time at which attention becomes maximal during the
progress of a single test.</p>

<p>9. The ground for these facts of modification is found in the
strength of the association between these several factors and the
elements that signify number.</p>

<p>10. The basis for the different tendencies found among the observers
is the differing vividness among several factors. If the vivid
factor is associated with the idea of numerousness, or is in this respect
neutral, its group will seem more numerous. If it has been
associated with the idea of fewness, its group will seem less numerous.
The difference between the two classes of "tendency" and "no-tendency"
lies in the fact that for the latter either only correct clues
are vivid, or else there is so frequent an alternation in vividness of
opposing incorrect clues that through any given series no tendency
appears, while for the "tendency" class misleading clues are without
shifting in the ascendant.</p>

<p>At the time when these experiments were completed, no work precisely
upon this problem had been published. Since then, however,
Dr. J. F. Messenger has issued a monograph entitled The Perception
of Number (Psych. Rev., Mono. Supp., vol. 5, no. 5), of
which certain parts fall within the scope of the present studies. He
was concerned with the estimation of absolute number and was
primarily interested to discover the nature of the number-judgment.
The reader of both articles will find agreement between the results
and interpretations here recorded and such part of Messenger's
work as has been a common object of study,&mdash;viz., the factors of
distribution and size.</p>

AGE, AND PHYSIOLOGICAL RHYTHMS</h2>

<p class="p1b">BY ROBERT M. YERKES AND F. M. URBAN</p>


<p>The desirability of a statistical study of time-estimation was suggested
to us by a note concerning "sex-differences in the sense of time"
which was published in Science recently by Prof. Robert MacDougall.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
By comparing the time-estimates of groups of men and women consisting
of fifteen individuals each, MacDougall discovered that for intervals
of from one quarter of a minute to a minute and a half, the
women exhibited a far stronger tendency to overestimate than did the
men, and were at the same time markedly less accurate. The nature
and extent of the overestimation discovered by MacDougall are indicated
by the results presented in the accompanying table from Science.
The numerals, 1, 2, 3, and 4 refer to different fillings of the
intervals (listening to reading, marking letters, etc.), the signs +
and - to over- and under-estimation respectively.</p>

<p>These apparent sex-differences in time-estimation demand further
attention, first, because the number of individuals studied by MacDougall,
as he recognized, is too small to establish the fact of the
existence of such differences, and, second, because if the differences
really do exist they should be studied in their relations to age and the
fundamental physiological rhythms.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>It seemed probable that further investigation of this subject might
reveal some important facts concerning the development of the ability<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
to estimate time in the individual, the significance of various conditions
for time-estimation, the psychology of sex, and the relations
of rhythms to personal affinities, antipathies, and motor capacities.</p>

<p>In this report the results of a statistical study of the sex-differences
in time-estimation are discussed, and in later papers we shall present
the results of investigations of the relations of time-estimation to age
and to individual and sex rhythms, and attempt to work out a convenient
and serviceable rhythm-formula. The need of such a formula for
expressing individual rhythms is obvious, as is also the need of comparative
studies of individual and sex rhythms.</p>

<p>The experimental data now to be considered were obtained as follows.
Record-sheets of the form reproduced above were printed, with
blanks for age and name of subject, place, date, for sixteen judgments
of time-intervals (numerals 1 to 16), for a statement of the subject's
method of estimating time, for the number of letters counted in thirty
seconds, and for the pulse-rate. Four intervals were used, 18, 36, 72, and
108 seconds, and for each of these intervals judgments were taken
under the four conditions designated on the record-sheet as idleness,
reading, writing, and estimating. In the experiments the intervals were
not given in order of regular increase or decrease of the length of interval,
nor were all the judgments for any one interval taken together, but
instead, for the purpose of avoiding the influence of expectation of
a particular interval or filling, they were arranged irregularly in the
order of column two of the record-sheet. This column, as also columns
three and four, which are specimen series of judgments for a male
and a female respectively, of course were not printed on the record-sheets
which were supplied to the subjects.</p>

<p>The experimental procedure was as follows:</p>

<p>(1) Each subject was given a record-sheet.</p>

<p>(2) The experimenter was provided with a record-sheet on which
the time of the intervals numbered from 1 to 16 was given. Care was
taken that the subjects should not know the length of the intervals
before the experiments.</p>

<p>(3) The beginning of each interval was indicated to the subjects by
the word "start" uttered distinctly by the experimenter; the end, by
the word "stop."</p>

<p>(4) Before beginning the sixteen tests the experimenter gave a thirty-second
interval as a standard of judgment. The experiment then proceeded
with only sufficient pause between judgments to allow of the
recording of estimates by the subjects.</p>

<p>(5) During the filling called "idleness" the subject did not pay
special attention to the estimation of the time, but instead permitted
his attention to wander.</p>

<p>(6) During "reading" the experimenter read aloud to the subjects.</p>

<p>(7) During "writing" the subjects wrote from the dictation of the
experimenter.</p>

<p>(8) During "estimating" the subjects judged the interval as accurately
as they could, by whatever method they chose except the use of
a time-piece.</p>

<p>(9) Each subject recorded his judgment of the length of an interval
in seconds at the appropriate place on the record-sheet as soon as the
interval was ended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span></p>

<p>(10) The question following judgment number 16 on the sheet was
answered as soon as the sixteen judgments had been recorded.</p>

<p>(11) The number of letters counted in thirty seconds was determined
by the use of the lines of letters at the bottom of the sheet. The
subjects began at the left of each line and counted singly as many
letters as they could between the "start" and "stop" signals of the experimenter.
They then marked the last letter counted and immediately
recorded, in the place provided on the record-sheet, the number of
letters counted.</p>

<p>(12) The pulse was counted by the experimenter immediately after
the experiment when possible and the rate recorded on the sheet.</p>

<p>(13) The experimenter avoided delays, interruptions, or other irregularities
in the course of the series of experiments.</p>

<p>The materials for our discussion of the sex-differences in time-estimation
consist of the judgments of 251 males and 274 females. The
majority of the males were students in Harvard College, the majority
of the females, in Radcliffe and Smith Colleges. The remainder of the
records were obtained in Ohio State University, Pomona College, and
West Chester State Normal School. The authors gratefully acknowledge
their indebtedness for assistance in the obtaining of records to
Professors A. H. Pierce, T. H. Haines, W. H. Scott, D. R. Major,
A. M. Smith, H. A. Miller, and B. T. Baldwin. The males ranged
in age from 17 to 23 years, the females from 17 to 20. The total number
of judgments, the distribution of which among the various ages
is shown in Table 1, is 4014 for the males, 4375 for the females.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that our experiments are open to the criticisms of all
work done under variable conditions and by different experimenters,
it cannot be doubted that the results indicate certain sex-differences
in time-estimation which suggest additional problems. For the present
we refrain from interpretations for the most part and state merely the
statistical results of the investigation.</p>

<p>Previous studies of the "time-sense" and the conditions which
influence time-estimation suggested to us the desirability of examining
our data with reference to (1) sex-differences in estimates of intervals,
(2) age-differences, (3) the influence of different fillings, and (4)
differences dependent upon the length of the interval. The results
have been studied, therefore, with reference to the significance of sex,
age, filling, and length of interval, but as no marked age-differences
appeared, the detailed tables which were constructed to exhibit the
results for the subjects of each year of age have not been printed.</p>

<p>In all the tables the results for males and females are presented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
separately. The judgments for the sixteen intervals are arranged with
reference to the length of the interval, not in the order in which they

<p>A general survey of the individual records, all of which for any one
year and sex were tabulated, for convenience of examination, on a
single large sheet of coÃ¶rdinate paper, showed that the judgments vary
within a wide range and are very inexact. Table 2 exhibits the number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
of correct judgments for each sex, interval, and filling. Of the
4014 male judgments only 96 (2.39%) were correct; of the 4375
female judgments only 46 (1.05%) were correct. The number of correct
judgments decreases as the length of the interval increases.
For the 18-second intervals there were 7.37% for the males, 2.48%
for the females, while for the 108-second intervals there were only
0.10% and 0.37% respectively.</p>

<p><em>List of abbreviations which occur in the tables.</em></p>

<p>&#931; always designates the sum of the results of the column which it heads.</p>

<p>I, E, R, W refer respectively to the intervals of idleness, estimating, reading,
and writing.</p>

<p>The % sign refers to the value of the result in question in terms of the total
number of judgments.</p>

<p>C refers to the results of the letter-counting test.</p></blockquote>

<p>The male judgments for the 108-second intervals range from 11 to
300 seconds. If random guesses be made within these limits the probability
of the occurrence of right guesses (108&#733;) would be 1 in 290;
therefore among 1004 guesses (the number of male judgments for 108-second
intervals) 3.5 would be right. In the experiment only one judgment
of the 1004 was correct. For the other intervals, with the exception
of 18 seconds, the number of correct judgments is only slightly
greater than random guessing would have given. Both males and
females, however, show considerably more correct judgments for 18-second
intervals than the number of probable right guesses. Within
the range of the male judgments and for their number 16.9 right
guesses might be expected, for the females 10.9. In contrast with these
numbers the experiments furnished 74 and 27 correct judgments
respectively.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that for those intervals which are most frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
correctly judged, not only is the number of correct judgments greater
for the males than for the females (the ratio of the percentages is about
3 to 1), but the ratio of the number of correct judgments to the probable
number of right guesses is also greater for the males.</p>

<p>The female judgments vary within a wider range and are less often
correct than the male. For the latter the total number of correct judgments
is more than twice that for the former.</p>

<p>Another interesting fact concerning the judgments of the time-intervals
is that certain numerals occur in the last place of a judgment more
frequently than we should expect if their occurrence depended on random
guessing. Tables 3 and 4 exhibit the results of an analysis of the
data made for the purpose of studying this fact. In Table 3 the frequency
of occurrence of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, etc., in the last place of the
male judgments is given for each filling under the four intervals. For
example, the digit 0 occurred in the last place of the male judgments
for the interval reading 36 seconds 98 times, as we learn by referring to
the first line and third row of the second column of Table 3.</p>

<p>Examination of Tables 3 and 4 shows at once the marked preference
of the subjects for 0 and 5. The percentage of male judgments
which end in 0 is 41.50; of female 58.51. Similarly the percentages of
occurrence of the digit 5 for the males is 24.41, and for the females
23.11. Only two of the other digits (2 and 8) occur with a frequency
of over 5%.</p>

<p>Among the 4014 male judgments 0 occurred as a final digit 1666
times, 5, 980 times. Among the 4375 female judgments 0 occurred
2560 times, 5, 1011 times. In the male judgments 0 occurred about four
times as often as it would in random guessing; in the female, almost
six times as often.</p>

<p>Comparison of Tables 3 and 4 indicates that the occurrence of 0 is
17.10% greater for the females, while that of 5 is 1.30% greater for
the males. The sum of the percentages of occurrence of 0 and 5
for the males is 65.91, therefore the probability that a male judgment
ends in one of these digits is almost twice that in favor of any other
digit. For the females the sum of the same percentages is 81.62, and
the probability of occurrence of 0 or 5 is therefore more than four
times that of the other eight digits.</p>

<p>Tables 3 and 4 show that even numbers occur more frequently than
uneven as final digits. Of the total number of judgments 2461 (3063)<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>
end with even digits and 1553 (1312) with uneven.</p>

<p>In order that the probability of the occurrence of even and uneven
numbers may be calculated, those judgments which end in 0 and 5
must be subtracted from the total number of judgments, for the occurrence
of these two digits is apparently due to a constant influence. The
problem may be formulated thus. First, what is the probability that a
judgment is determined by the constant influence in favor of 0 and 5?
Second, what is the probability of even and uneven numbers, when the
influence in favor of 0 and 5 is eliminated? The calculated probability
of 0 or 5 is 0.65919 (0.81622) and therefore the probability that a given
judgment is not determined by this influence is 0.34081 (0.18378). The
probable limits of these numbers are 0.00505 (0.00395).</p>

<p>After the subtraction of those judgments which end in 0 or 5, there
remain 1368 (804), of which 795 (503) are even and 573 (301) uneven.
The probability of an even number is 0.58115 (0.62562) and the
inverse probability of an uneven number is 0.41885 (0.37438). The
probable limits of these numbers are 0.00900 (0.01027). There are
therefore even chances that the percentage of occurrence of even numbers
is between the limits 57.215 and 59.015 (61.535 and 63.589), or
outside these limits.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>Statistical studies have already proved that in random guessing even
numbers occur somewhat more frequently than uneven. It is therefore
worthy of notice that in these results the frequencies of even numbers
are not uniformly greater than that of uneven; for with the exception
of the digit 6 in the female judgments, the digits next to 0 and 5, <em>i. e.</em>,
9 and 1, 4 and 6, occur with least frequency.</p>

<p>In the case of the number of letters counted in a half minute, also, it
appears (see last column (C) of Tables 3 and 4) that 0 and 5 occur
more frequently in the last place than chance would lead us to expect.
In contrast with the results for the time-judgments, in the same tables,
the percentages of occurrence of the various digits in counting present
less marked differences. For the males 3 and 7 occur least frequently,
for the females 2 and 9.</p>

<p>To sum up the results of our examination of the materials with reference
to the occurrence of digits in the final place of the judgments, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
order of decreasing frequency of the various digits is 0, 5, 8, and 2. Of
the others 3 and 7 occur more frequently than 4 and 6, with one exception.
The statement that even numbers in general occur more
frequently than odd must be modified by the statement that in these
results the digits next to 0 and 5, namely, 9, 1, 4, and 6 occur with
least frequency. These statements hold for both males and females,
but for the latter the frequency of occurrence of 0 is far greater than
for the males.</p>

<p>These results clearly indicate that the judgments are not random
guesses. In seeking further for some explanation of the surprising frequency
of occurrence of judgments which end in 0 or 5, we discovered
that certain numbers occur very frequently, namely, the multiples of
15, 30, and 60. In order to exhibit this tendency quantitatively Tables
5 and 6 have been constructed.</p>

<p>In these tables will be found tabulated the number of times 15 and
multiples of it which are not also multiples of 30 or 60 occur for any
given interval and filling. Likewise are tabulated the frequencies of
occurrence of 30 and multiples of it which are not multiples of 60, and
finally, of 60 and its multiples. The numbers as they occurred in the
three categories run as follows:</p>

<p>Fifteen and its multiples, as given above, are arranged in one division
of the tables, thirty and sixty each in its own separate division.
The line at the bottom of the tables marked &#931; gives the frequency of
occurrence of these three groups of numbers for all the subjects and
for each interval and filling.</p>

<p>As is shown by the percentage of frequency columns of the tables,
in no instance do the multiples of 15 constitute less than 19.52% of the
male judgments and 23.81% of the female judgments. The lowest frequency
for any of the four intervals is 20.32% of the total number of
judgments. The maximum frequency for the males (43.03%) and for
the females (56.57%) is for the interval idleness 108 seconds. That the
male and female maxima should fall on the same interval is interesting.</p>

<p>If no influence worked in favor of the multiples of 15 in these experiments
only one judgment in thirty would be 15 (3.33%) and only one
in sixty, 30 or 60 (1.67%). For the probability of the occurrence of
15, 30, and 60 is <span class="hfrac"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">60</span></span> + <span class="hfrac"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">60</span></span> + <span class="hfrac"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">30</span></span> = <span class="hfrac"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">15</span></span>, as is obvious from the fact that
among sixty consecutive numbers (1 to 60) there are four which are
multiples of 15. According to probability we should expect multiples
of 15, 30, and 60 to occur 268 times among the 4014 male judgments
and 292 times among the 4375 female judgments. As a matter
of fact there are 1212 such judgments for the males, 1715 for the females.
The probability that a male judgment is a multiple of 15, 30, or
60 is 0.3012 (probable error 0.0049); for a female judgment the probability
is 0.39199 (probable error 0.0050).</p>

<p>These statistics indicate that the subjects are constantly and strongly
influenced in favor of judgments which are simple fractions of a minute.
Closer inspection of the tables gives some suggestion of the
nature of this influence.</p>

<p>Comparison of the four intervals (Tables 5 and 6) with respect to
the occurrence of simple fractions of a minute shows that the frequency
of such numbers increases rapidly as the length of the interval increases.
The various percentages of frequency for males and females and for
the four intervals are again presented here for convenience of comparison.</p>

<p>As is obvious from these figures both frequency and rate of increase
are far higher for the females than for the males.</p>

<p>Examination of the percentages (totals) at the bottom of Tables 5
and 6 reveals another remarkable sex-difference; for the frequency of
occurrence of 15 and its multiples regularly decreases for males from
the 15 to the 60 class, whereas for females it regularly increases.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the time-judgments of these experiments were
strongly influenced by thought of the conventional time-unit, the minute,
for in all quantitative work there are errors in favor of the standard
of measurement and simple fractions thereof. In the present
instance this tendency to favor the unit was strengthened, perhaps,
by the giving of a half-minute interval as a standard for comparison at
the beginning of the tests.</p>

<p>Two explanations of the sex-differences above mentioned are suggested
by our study of the data. One is the fact that the females are
less exact than the males; the other that they generally overestimate
the intervals, whereas the males often underestimate them. One's
estimate of an interval is determined partly by confidence of accuracy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
The longer an interval the less we feel able to estimate it accurately,
and, as a consequence, the more frequently it is judged as the same as
the time-unit or a simple fraction of that unit. The females are less
exact in their estimates than the males, and less exact for long than for
short intervals, and as an accompaniment of their inexactitude we find
the frequent occurrence of multiples of 15, 30, and 60.</p>

<p>But confidence of ability to estimate accurately must be considered
in connection with the fact which suggests our second explanation,
namely, that the female estimates are higher than the male. Tables
7 and 8 show that the females almost invariably overestimate the intervals
rather largely, while the males sometimes underestimate considerably.
The range of the male judgments is from 1 to 300, of the female
from 1 to 400. Obviously the chance of occurrence of 15, 30, 60, and
their multiples varies with the range. The greater the range the greater
the probable frequency of 30 and 60 in comparison with 15. In random
guessing the probabilities of the occurrence of 15, 30, and 60 for long
and short intervals is the same, but our results show that this is not
true in the case of these time-estimation judgments. It seems possible,
therefore, that the sex-differences referred to are due to the fact that the
intervals seem longer to the females, and that, therefore, a feeling of
greater inexactitude than would be felt for shorter intervals leads to
the choice of simple fractions of a minute more frequently than in the
male judgments and more frequently for the long than for the short
intervals.</p>

<p>It is of interest in this connection to note that the length of a second
is usually underestimated by females, overestimated by males. The
average number of seconds counted in half a minute by twenty men
and twenty women was as follows:</p>

<p class="center"><em>Men.</em> M. 30.4, M.V. 8.7, R.V. 34.94. <em>Women.</em> M. 38.9, M.V. 10.6, R.V. 36.70</p>

<p>These figures would seem to indicate that the overestimation of the
intervals of these experiments by the females is due to the use of a time-unit
which is shorter than that of the males (although presumably of
the same length).</p>

<p>We cannot with certainty say whether inaccuracy of judgment
stands in the relation of condition or consequence of the occurrence
of simple fractions of a minute, but it would appear that the female
tendency to overestimate is responsible for the sex-differences already
noted. For whatever be the facts concerning longer intervals the second
as judged by the female is considerably shorter than that of the male.</p>

<p>Since a complicated periodicity of frequency in the distribution of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
the judgments is exhibited in the results of Tables 3-6 it is obvious that
the distribution-curve will have a tertiary mode for each number ending
in 0 or 5, a secondary mode for 15, 30, 60, and their multiples, and a
primary mode which may or may not coincide with one of the secondary
or tertiary modes. Extreme irregularity is characteristic of the distribution-curve.
Different groups of judgments, as, for example, those
for the two sexes, those for the different intervals, etc., give somewhat
different forms of distribution, for the frequency of occurrence of 0 and
5, as well as of the multiples of 15, is variable.</p>

<p>These facts are important in connection with the selection of an
interval for the construction of the distribution-curves, in that they indicate
how large the interval or class of the distribution-curves and tables
should be.</p>

<p>It is clear from the results of Tables 3 and 4 that the smallest interval
which can be of value is 10 seconds, for a smaller interval would necessarily
exhibit irregularities due to the greater frequency of 0 than of 5.
The question is whether the interval can be so enlarged, without the
loss of all details of the nature of the distribution, that every class will
represent the influence of the same conditions. For this purpose only
three intervals are possible: 10, 30, and 60 seconds. Of these 30 and 60
are undesirable because the interval 60 gives classes which are so large
that all details of the distribution are lost, while 30 exhibits only a few
details without doing away with the periodicity due to the preference
for multiples of 60.</p>

<p>The further question remains, with which digit should the interval
end, in order that uniformity of conditions for the various classes may
be gained? Theoretically there are ten possibilities, but of these all
except two, 0 and 5, are excluded by reason of the unequal frequency
of the various digits already discussed. In favor of 0 is the fact that all
the classes thus formed are of equal size, <em>i. e.</em> 1-10, 11-20, etc., whereas
for 5 the first class would differ from the others in being only half as
large, 1-5. This, however, is only a slight disadvantage, for there are
very few judgments which fall in this class. On the other hand, since
0 is the final digit of most frequent occurrence, classes ending in 5 have
the advantage of placing the value of greatest weight in the middle.
On the whole it seemed desirable to arrange the judgments in 10
second classes, beginning with the class 1-10. But for purposes of
comparison the male judgments have been distributed in classes of 10
seconds, which end in 5, 1-5, 6-15, 16-25, etc.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>As a result of these groupings of the male judgments it appeared
that the former method gives a far more regular distribution than the
latter. In view of this result and the above considerations, Tables 7
and 8 were constructed by the use of 10-second classes, beginning with
1-10. In these tables (column C) the distribution of the letter-counting
results has been included for convenience of comparison of the two
kinds of judgments as to form of distribution.</p>

<p>As instances of the general form of distribution of the judgments
the curves have been plotted for letter-counting, Fig. 1 <em>A</em>. (Males &mdash;&mdash;,
Females, ... ,) for idleness 36 seconds, Fig. 1 <em>B</em>, and for idleness 108
seconds, Fig. 2. The distribution of the letter-counting judgments in
classes of 10 is very regular in comparison with that of the several time-estimation
judgments. For idleness 36 seconds there are several fairly
distinct modes, and for idleness 108 seconds the modes are still more
numerous and more marked.</p>

<p>Tables 7 and 8 show that the range of the judgments increases with
the length of the interval judged, and that the modal class is always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
much nearer the lower than the upper limit. Asymmetry is characteristic
of the distribution of organic data, and in certain instances, as for
example writing 18 seconds, males, the choice of a 10-second class
interval results in extreme asymmetry, and one is reminded of the tables
which Fechner gave as examples of his logarithmic method in statistics.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>It is not to be expected that a method of grouping should be found
which will give regularity of distribution throughout, but it is important
that there should be regularity about the mode. In the table of
distribution for the males (Table 7) all the intervals from idleness
18 seconds to reading 72 seconds are regular.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> The remaining intervals,
with the exception of estimating 108 seconds, are irregular.</p>

<p>Trial proves that for these intervals increase of the size of the class
to 30 seconds is sufficient to give regular distributions, as is obvious
from Table 9. Grouping by 30-second classes gives regularity for most
of the female judgments, but for idleness 108 seconds and writing 108
seconds there are still slight irregularities, as Table 10 indicates.</p>

<p>Tables 7 and 8 show that the distribution is far less regular for the
females than for the males. The fact that it becomes regular when the
class interval is increased to 30 seconds suggests that the irregularities
of distribution which appear in the tables are due to those influences
which favor simple fractions of a minute and not to the small
number of judgments.</p>

<p>Having now noted certain important characteristics of the time-estimation
judgments and the nature of their distribution, we may
examine the arithmetical means and other statistical quantities which
have been determined for our data. Those quantities which have been
determined for the several ages, intervals, and fillings as well as for
the sexes are: (1) The Mean (<em>M.</em> in tables), (2) the average variability
(<em>M. V.</em>), (3) the positive variability (+ <em>V.</em>), (4) the number
of judgments with positive variation (No. + <em>V.</em>), (5) the negative
variability (&ndash; <em>V.</em>), (6) the number of judgments with negative variation
(No. &ndash; <em>V.</em>), (7) the relative variability (<em>R. V.</em>) = <span class="hfrac"><span class="numerator"><em>M</em> + <em>V</em></span><span class="denominator"><em>M</em></span></span> Ã 100.</p>

<p>Since the sums of the positive and the negative variations are equal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
it is possible to make certain of the accuracy of the means and average
variabilities by comparison of the + <em>V.</em> and &ndash; <em>V.</em> As this was done
in all cases we feel confident of the reliability of the statistical quantities
presented in the tables.</p>

<p>In Table 11 have been arranged the various quantities as determined
for the males and females for each interval. The values given in this
table are averages of the determinations made for the several ages
separately.</p>

<p>The following facts are revealed by comparison of the results for the
two sexes.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> Without exception the means for the females are larger
than those for the males. All but one of the sixteen intervals (E 18&#733;)
are underestimated by the males, whereas all but six are overestimated
by the females. The amount of over- and under-estimation is given in
Table 12. In every instance the females overestimate in comparison
with the males. The mean variability is very much greater for the
females, as is also the relative variability. If variability be taken as
a measure of reliability of judgment the males are far superior to the
females.</p>

<p>As is obvious from Table 12, both under- and over-estimation increase
with increase in the length of the interval. For 18&#733; intervals
they are least, for 108&#733; intervals greatest.</p>

<p>The influence of the fillings is marked. The writing intervals without
exception are judged as shortest; reading gives the next shortest
intervals, while sometimes idleness, sometimes estimating, comes
third. In order of increasing length of average estimates of the intervals
the fillings stand: writing, reading, idleness, estimating. As a rule the
averages for the idleness and the estimating intervals are nearly the
same, but it is worthy of note that the females always overestimate to
a greater extent when estimating than when idle. This is another
indication of the discrepancy between the female time-unit and the
objective unit.</p>

<p>About ninety per cent of the subjects estimated by some counting
method. The methods most frequently used were "counting seconds,"
counting "1 and 2 and 3 and 4, etc.," counting the swings of a pendulum,
tapping, and counting imaginary watch-ticks.</p>

<p>The above statements might suggest that the overestimation characteristic
of the female judgments is due to a more rapid counting rhythm.
This, however, is not true, for the letter-counting tests indicate a
slightly more rapid rhythm for the males, 93.42 as opposed to 91.89.</p>

<p>In Table 13 are the means, variabilities, errors, etc., for the letter-counting
tests. In this table we have presented the values of the various
statistical quantities for the several ages of both males and females,
for there are certain interesting differences which should be noted.
Similar age-tables have been prepared for all of the other results, but
in no case have noteworthy differences appeared. From Table 13 it
will be observed that the males on the average count more letters in
thirty seconds than do the females, and at the same time make more
errors. The mean and relative variabilities for the sex-groups are
almost the same. Curiously enough the number of letters counted as
well as the accuracy of counting decrease for the females with age (17
to 20 years being the age-limits of the group under consideration). The
males within the same age-limits increase in rapidity of counting, but
decrease in accuracy. In the examination of Table 13 it is to be remembered
that the 17 and 23 year groups of males contain only 16
individuals each, and therefore cannot be compared to advantage with
the other groups. Both mean and relative variabilities decrease from
17 to 20 years for the females, whereas for the males there is no constancy
in the direction of the change.</p>

women (ages 17 to 20 years).</p>

<p>(4) Both men and women favor estimates which end in 0 or 5, as well
as simple fractions of a minute, but the tendency is stronger in women
than in men. Over one third of the estimates reported in this paper
were 15 seconds or simple multiples thereof.</p>

<p>(5) In letter-counting the groups of subjects studied (251 men and
274 women) exhibited differences just the opposite of those in time-estimation,
for the men counted more rapidly and less accurately than
did the women.</p>

<p>(6) Of the four fillings for the intervals used in the experiments,
"writing" gave the smallest estimates of the intervals, listening to
"reading" next, while "idleness" and "estimating" were conditions
in which the intervals seemed much longer to both men and women.</p>

<p>(7) This preliminary study of sex-differences in time-estimation, by
which it has been learned that women overestimate and are notably
inaccurate in comparison with men, is to be followed and supplemented
by the results of an investigation now in progress concerning the relations
of sex-differences in time-estimation to age and physiological
rhythms.</p>

<h2><a name="ASSOCIATIONS_UNDER_THE_INFLUENCE_OF" id="ASSOCIATIONS_UNDER_THE_INFLUENCE_OF"></a>ASSOCIATIONS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF
DIFFERENT IDEAS</h2>

<p class="p1b">BY BIRD T. BALDWIN</p>


<p>The purpose of the following investigation was to study the influence
of two or more starting-points on the train of associated ideas.
It was begun in October, 1902, and concluded in January, 1905. Nineteen
graduate students acted as subjects, and the experiments were
conducted with each individually for one hour per week, except in a
few instances where two subjects were present together. Occasionally
the experimenter acted as subject in order to get a clearer insight into
introspective data. There are recorded here thirteen groups of one
hundred and eight sections, including eight hundred and fifty-five
separate experiments, with a sum total of eleven thousand, one hundred
and thirty-five named associations.</p>

<p>So far the field has not been studied experimentally, although Cordes,<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>
while attempting to observe the effect of an unconscious intermediating
factor in 'mediate association,' noticed that the accompanying factor
(particularly with a tone) sometimes combined with the starting-point
in determining the associated series. The fact is simply mentioned,
and Scripture's<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> conclusions from the same are inadequate when he
states, "In general we may say that two simultaneous ideas have an
effect that depends on their relative masses; if one of the ideas is over-poweringly
weighty the next idea will be chiefly influenced by it, but if
the two are nearly balanced the next idea will be the result of the two."
Miss Calkins<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> makes a near approach to the problem in a study of
"Mental Combination," where auditory words were given as nearly
simultaneously as possible and the subject was required to remain for
four seconds in silence and then to write the train of imagery which
passed in six following seconds; the words as auditory starting-points
were finally excluded from the experiments "because the first word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
pronounced tends often to establish itself so firmly that its association-images
are proof against the intrusion of the second word, which has
therefore no chance to be grasped with the first." These results differ
from the ones here recorded which were obtained independently and
under different conditions. In her valuable monograph on Association<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>
there is in one instance a suggestion of the problem, but no results are
given.</p>

<p>The two or more starting-points were nonsense syllables, concrete
or abstract words, pronounced by the investigator or shown on cards,
or finally, pictures. The associations continued for a period of fifty
seconds unless otherwise indicated. The same letters denote the
same subjects throughout all the experiments, K. and R. being women.
In the examples given, Roman numbers have been used, in place of
the letters, as it was found impossible to get representative series
which were entirely devoid of personal references.</p>

<p>After the associations had been "jotted down," the subjects in
each case copied them, noting also the suggesting ideas, and giving,
in many cases, a number of introspective notes. It is important to
mention that in all of the work these records of suggesting ideas
were made by the subjects without any questions on the part of the
investigator.</p>


<p class="p2b">G<span class="smcapa">ROUP</span> I. T<span class="smcapa">WO</span> N<span class="smcapa">ONSENSE</span> S<span class="smcapa">YLLABLES</span></p>

<p>In order that a standard might be obtained that would serve as a
basis for subsequent experiments, two nonsense syllables were pronounced
with equal emphasis, as starting-points, and the subject was
asked merely to wait until both had entered consciousness and not to
favor nor inhibit either. If the subject stated that associations arose
between the pronunciation of the starting-points the results were
discarded.</p>

<p>Turning to the notes we find that K. reported, "The first just hovered
around," and the associations followed the second, or as V. states
it, "Sof was carried subconsciously for a while without influence,"
while By. frequently noticed that "The first may be in the background
on the point of breaking in but be inhibited involuntarily," or in another,
"It was frequently present but exerting no influence." A. "forgot
what the other word was, but felt it trying to get a hand in." Ro. goes
further and states in terms similar to A., "The words which might have
been suggested by 'taf' were wholly inhibited, though I am sure 'taf'
was present to me throughout the series, but was not efficacious as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
against the other syllable." It is unnecessary to multiply instances
to show that the wraith, so to speak, of one may linger for a short time,
or occasionally for the entire series, but that the associations are
determined by the other. Or the lingering wraith of a starting-point
may hover ineffectively in consciousness and exert no determining
influence on the series until toward its close; then, however, although
both starting-points still persist, they exchange places so far as
effectiveness is concerned, and the former wraith becomes the
primary factor in effecting the series of associations. For example,
"The two syllables were present all the way through, but the former
exhausted itself as a word-suggester after a few words." Again Ro.
gives examples where "One alone may be in consciousness and determine
the associations when the other may enter without effect
upon the series, or may determine the series, the first persisting but
losing its effect"; and a case of both ideas persisting and each alternately
exerting an influence was noted by M. These last two conditions
are exceptional.</p>

<p>Studying carefully the notes and graphic representations as given
in the tables, it is apparent that one starting-point may be followed
independently and exclusively; we find "'fef' suggesting 'theft,' and
the subsequent associations monopolizing the field of consciousness
and 'tuz' not again appearing." (V.) The results show that in the
one hundred and seven experiments one was followed exclusively only
twenty times. The following would be an example:</p>

<p>In other cases one starting-point may be followed and then the other
for a few or many associations, each "occupying the mind to the
exclusion of the other for a number of words, when suddenly the
other appears and suggests a new series," which V. calls "a curious
zigzagging in consciousness." This may take place at any point
along the series. As Ro. indicates, "There was rivalry here; 'yud'
wholly inhibited all the 'zid' associations, even 'zid' itself for the
time, then, 'yud' apparently being exhausted, 'zid' entered again
into the focus."</p>

<p>In contrast to the above forms, the tables indicate and the notes
verify that while the associations primarily follow one there can be
traced the modifying effect of the other; "The nature of the words
was influenced by a fringe of consciousness which contains the other
starting-point," M.'s comment runs, while J. adds, "The other helped
in the mental picture but had no special significance." There are no
experiments in the first group where this partial fusion took place
throughout the series, and there are only six examples where it took
place before the sixth word and continued to the end. While there
are no cases here of alternating partial fusion, yet it sometimes happens,
that is, the predominating influence is sometimes transferred
from one to the other. The modifying influence may reach such a
degree at any point in the series that the identity of each point of departure
of the association is lost and there is total fusion, resulting in
one idea or one train of thought. For example, 'rel' and 'mem' gave
'realm' for V.; for Ht. 'fef' and 'tuz' gave 'fezz'; for M. they gave
'fez'; for Ro. 'fuz.'</p>

<p>Of the twenty-one experiments where one starting-point was followed
exclusively, there were two cases for the first and nineteen for
the second. There were but two cases of alternating groups, a third
one being unique in that after the first three words there was a persistent
alternation between two apparently independent series of
inter-related words and inter-related visual images. There were three
cases of complete fusion throughout the series and nine where total
fusion started before the fifth word and continued.</p>

<p>In a number of cases the initial starting-points were forgotten before
the end of the series and the subjects were sometimes unable to recall
them.</p>

<p>As the subjects were kept ignorant of the characteristic persistence
of either starting-point in forming separate associations, and of the
tendency towards fusion, as well as of the preponderance of influence
of one over the other, it is to the tabulated results that we must look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
for quantitative measurement of these. 76.2% of the associations are
due to the independent influence of one or the other of the starting-points;
23.9% are due to the combined influence; for the first starting-point
we have 18.7%, for the second 57.5%. In 15.3% of all the
associations the combined influence was the result of total fusion; in
4.1%, the result of a union where the first starting-point predominated
in influence; in 4.4%, the second predominated. The following
graphic representation indicates the order of influences for the first
pair of syllables. The table gives the results for the ten pairs.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Number of subjects, 11; number of sections, 10; number of experiments, 110;
number of associations, 1569.</p></blockquote>


<p class="p2b">G<span class="smcapa">ROUP</span> II</p>

<p>Two concrete nouns with apparently equivalent connotation were
pronounced. In order that the subject get no clue as to the preponderance
of one starting-point over the other, the nine sections were given
at irregular intervals in connection with other experiments.</p>

<p>The tables show few cases of fusion, there being but one case in the
eighty experiments where all the associations were the result of the
combined influence of both starting-points. There was no other
instance where complete fusion took place before the sixth association
and continued throughout, and only six cases where any form of
fusion took place in the eighty experiments within the first five words
(7.6%), while in the one hundred and seven experiments of Group I
there were twenty-five (23.9%).</p>

<p>The tables show a tendency which was noted when two syllables
were used and which is emphatically brought out here, namely, it is
the position or sequence which determines which of the two equivalent
starting-points shall produce the greater influence. When the two
starting-points are given in immediate succession, it is the second
which predominates in influence. This preponderance may be clearly
demonstrated by the tables alone, though there are many notes which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
show "the greater influence of one" (the second). A. seems to have
realized this when he wrote, "While the first was uppermost the second
hovered in subconsciousness, resting content, knowing that it would
have its turn soon." In corroboration the tables give&mdash;abstracting
from all cases of fusion&mdash;268 words (23.2%) for the first, 721 words
(62.3%) for the second. In fifty-five of the eighty experiments the last
had full control at the end of the series. Taking the cases where one
was followed exclusively throughout the series, starting between the
first and the sixth named association, we find eight for the first and
twenty-nine for the second. This greater influence is again to be found
in the cases of partial fusion; the first predominating in 2.6%, and the
second in 4.3%.</p>

<p>The results of both groups show that the starting-points tend in
a high degree toward independent influence, and also that such a
method of presentation is one of sequence rather than simultaneity,
as the two words show unequal influence. The former must in a manner
be reproduced to become a point of departure for associations,
while the latter acts directly. Is it then a condition of mind that when
similar impressions are presented the one in the presence of which
consciousness is reacting directly has a greater influence in arousing
associations than one which is just past? This we are forced to
conclude is the case, but the proof of the conclusion will be supplemented
by later results.</p>

<p>Number of subjects, 9; number of sections, 19; number of experiments, 80;

<p>For two syllables and like words the second strongly predominates
in awakening associations; will the same be true when two simple outline
pictures are shown in the same order? The following results show
in attestation of the above conclusion percentages remarkably similar
to those of the words. There are 23.7% for the first and 61% for the
second; 84.7% of the associations show no sign of fusion and only
15.3% for fusion and the different forms of partial fusion, the second
still holding the ascendency. When the two pictures did fuse, R. tells
us, "All the associations were more elaborate pictures than when mere
words were given."</p>

<p>A comparative study, inadequate though it is, offers a partial parallelism
between the predominating memory type and stimulation.
The subjects who are preÃ«minently of the visual, K., visual motor, M.,
H., V., and visual lingual motor, Ht., find the pictures more suggestive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
than the syllables, while those of the pure motor, F. and By., reverse
the order and find that the syllables offer more numerous and "more
vivid" (F.) associations.</p>

<p>Common experience, however, immediately shows the limitations
of reaching conclusions, when considering prolificacy as criteria of
suggestiveness, inasmuch as starting-points which are abundantly
rich in associations tend to produce so many points of departure that
they tend to inhibit one another. Again there is to be considered the
kind of associations, those of the syllables being of a very elementary
character and in serial form.</p>

<p>A few experiments were given in which colored slips of paper were
used as starting-points. These proved very suggestive for the subjects.
Also a few tones were given, but these were soon discontinued, as other
tones, which could not be recorded, were frequently suggested. The
sentence which forms a very satisfactory starting-point where one is
used could not be used to an advantage where several were given. As
we are here interested in the mutual influence of the starting-points,
our remaining study will be confined to a quantitative and qualitative
variation of the forms used in the previous groups.</p>

<p>The previous experiments suggest the conclusion that that starting-point
in the presence of which consciousness is reacting exerts
a greater influence than one just past. The proof of this anticipated
result is supplemented by subsequent consectary data.</p>

<p>It is necessary to test the outcome when the nature of the impressions
is varied and the starting-points are given simultaneously. An
outline picture and a word may be so given. These experiments
verify from a different standpoint the statement that the picture
establishes itself more permanently and is more influential, there being
47.8% of the associations produced by the picture alone, 14.8%
by the words alone, 25% of a fusion of the two, and 12.4% of a
uniting influence with the first predominating. The subject R. is an
exception in that she favors the word when not favoring a combination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
of the two, a fact which I am unable to explain except to add
that the subject stated that the Ã¦sthetic pleasure connected with the
picture was sufficient to inhibit the associations. K. has 100% for
the pictures, which is partially explained by the fact that she is a remarkable
visualizer who reproduces all situations in visual terms.</p>

<p>The character of the starting-points determines which shall be followed
in a simultaneous presentation; can the character of two immediately
successive starting-points be so varied as to overcome the
factor of temporal difference? The few experiments in this group show
an attempt to shift and measure this influence, selecting as variants
words of general and specific character, the first being a term of everyday
experience with the subjects, of wide connotation, and therefore
presumably rich in associations, and the second, which had the advantage
of position, one of more limited and specific connotation, thus in a
measure making it possible to test the stability of the second in establishing
itself as a word-suggester. For the words "Gymnasium&mdash;Stamens"
the second still strongly predominates. There is a slight increase
in the amount of fusion (24.5% in all), the explanation of which
would probably lie in the fact that the first is more assertive than
before and offers more elements common to the two. There was one
case of total fusion, one case where fusion started before the sixth
word and continued, no cases of alternating fusion, four cases of partial
fusion, five cases where the second was followed throughout, no
case where the first was followed throughout, five cases of alternation
between the first and the second. In 75.5%, the influence was exerted
without fusion. Eight of the nine subjects favor the specific term.</p>

<p>What modification of influence takes place when an auditory impression
in the form of a word of abstract nature (the pure abstract
words are taken later) is given in comparison with a concrete noun?
The tables indicate that we are now able partly to overcome the
disadvantage of first position by the advantage of concrete content.
24% of the associations are the result of total fusion; there are eight
cases of total fusion throughout the series, and seven where total
fusion took place before the third word and continued. There are
two cases where the first was followed throughout, and but one where
the second was followed exclusively. The tables indicate that there
were very few words. Some of the subjects claim, "These words did
not seem equally rich in associations. I was not at all conscious of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
the one while the other was in consciousness." (H.) The most characteristic
feature here was, as Br. also indicates, "Great amount of
rivalry at the beginning of the series"; while Bs. states, "There was
a lot of confusion and a feeling of groping for words." Br. adds later,
"For some seconds association seemed obstructed. Then by an
effort the process was started which followed an involuntary course.
A kind of confused presence of both words." Another subject adds,
"There was a long blank after the words were said in which both
words were balancing off in the fringe of consciousness and the mind
expectant, passively waiting for an association to turn up. The
hesitant period seemed marked by an attempt at a synthesis of these
two words in some way."</p>

<p>As the tables indicate, there was frequently a strong tendency here
for the abstract terms to fuse. As H. noticed, "It does not tend to call
up associations of its own stripe, but in some way becomes concrete."</p>

<p>Reversing the order by placing the concrete noun second, it gains
in influence. We are told by the subjects at this point, "The choice
seems to be determined by the concreteness of the word." (H.) "The
abstract soon exhausted itself as a word-suggester." (Ro.) There was
fusion in 24% of the associations of the first group, and 22.2% in the
second. There are six cases where the second alone prevails, two for
the first starting-point and four for the second. There are eleven cases
of fusion beginning before the sixth word and continuing throughout
the series. There is much partial fusion, with the second predominating
in influence.</p>

<p>The results again emphasize the fact that the influence is transferable,
also that normally the second has the advantage; furthermore,
they illustrate the preponderance of the concrete word as a starter of
associations, and that the abstract term when it exerts an influence
tends to fuse rather than persist in having separate associations; all of
which shows that concrete terms produce more vivid impressions than
abstract ones, and would, when it is possible to use them, be of direct
aid to the learner.</p>

<p>Increasing the disparateness by making the one a proper name and
the other a pure abstract noun, we find the name dominates consciousness,
almost to the exclusion of the abstract term. The tables confirm
the conclusions that the abstract term, even when given the advantage
of position, exerts little influence, for in the first group of eighteen experiments
of two hundred and eighty-four associations there are 13.4
times as many associations for the first as for the second, or two hundred
and fifteen words for the first (75.8%) and sixteen (5.5%) for
the second.</p>

<p>Reversing the order, the burden of influence swings back to thirty-eight
(12.8%) for the first and one hundred and fifty-six (52.7%) for
the second with an amount of fusion increased to ninety-nine (33.4%).</p>

<p>Occasional experiments of the previous groups indicated an abnormal
influence of those ideas which were accentuated by the special
interests of the subjects. We ask therefore: What is the relation of the
newly aroused associations to the present content of consciousness?
May the present content of consciousness be so varied as to reÃ«nforce
or inhibit the characteristic influence of the individual impressions
successively presented? In order to test this, words or a sentence were
pronounced just previous to the presentation of the two starting-points
related to them as follows; in the first divisions the preparatory words
lead to the second, in the second divisions to the first, in the third
divisions to neither, in the fourth divisions to both, and in the last we
have a slight change in the marginal setting and a sentence leads to the
second.</p>

<p>The following are examples of the first and second divisions:</p>

<p>That one starting-point establishes itself more firmly, and offers
more dominant associations with an increased degree of suggestiveness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
is intimated by various expressions of the subjects who state, "the preparatory
words called forth associations connected with this or that
starting-point"; or "there was a felt fusion of all"; "a summation of
all"; or "the preparatory words had an influence throughout"; "they
strengthened this or that starting-point"; "they affected one and not
the other"; and many similar expressions.</p>

<p>The influence of these preparatory marginal settings was also indicated
very often by the nature or kind of words in the series.</p>

<p>Turning to the tables which collectively represent in a graphic and
quantitative form the notes of the subject, and which are in harmony
with the above, we find they demonstrate that there is a very intimate
and definite relationship. When the state of mind immediately
preceding the moment of the formation of the associated series is
conditioned by the preparatory words leading to the second, the
amount to which that starting-point dominates consciousness in
arousing associations is greater than in any previous case where the
words of like nature are pronounced.</p>

<p>With the preparatory words leading to the second starting-point,
we have 11.5% of the influence for the first, 69.2% for the second;
with them leading to the first, 58.2% for first, 17.2% for second;
with them leading to neither, 40.6% for first, 44.2% for second; with
them leading to both, 16.1% for first, 54.8% for second; with a
preparatory sentence leading to second, 12.9% for first, 59.7% for
second.</p>

<p>A few experiments were made where one word was given as a setting
and four or eight starting-points were shown, but the starting-points
were so numerous that they tended to confuse the subject's introspective
account.</p>

<p>The aim here is to test the effect of interruption in the series of associations,
and to throw further light on the relation of the series to
the present content of consciousness when this content is a series of
associations and the new content is a pronounced word which is to act
as a point of departure for new associations.</p>

<p>There are three divisions. The time in all is fifty seconds; in
the first a word of general connotation is given and after an interim
of ten seconds a second more specific word is pronounced. In the
second three similar words are given at an interval of fifteen seconds;
the third four words with an interval of ten seconds. The following
are examples of the first and third divisions:</p>

<p>In all the experiments the subject simply knew that possibly more
than one starting-point would be given. There was of course the
conscious recognition on the part of the subjects that the pronounced
words were starting-points, which would imply an attentive consciousness,
but they were cautioned neither to favor nor inhibit the
newly pronounced word nor an association in progress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span></p>

<p>The notes are uniform in showing that often one, two or three words
of the former association-series are written after the new word is pronounced.
"The momentum," says F., "was great enough to carry the
associations two or three words beyond the pronounced word"; while
Bl. found "a tendency for the trend of associations to persist, though
not strong enough to overcome the new influence." By.'s experience
was slightly different. As stated before, he often wrote the word as it
came into consciousness. "On hearing a new word it gets precedence
over the next associations not yet formed, and there is considerable
confusion and lost time unless the motor discharge of writing the pronounced
word is permitted to have free expression." The tables verify
the same, and also show that there are more associations during the
first interval.</p>

<p>Does a former starting-point regain its influence? In the first
division there are two cases where the first and second fuse, but no
place where the first independently forms an association; in the second
but one word for subject Bl. in "Quill&mdash;Bench&mdash;Chalk," and in the
third not any. There was a small amount of fusion in all, since but
two words are due to the combined influence of the first and third,
five to the combined influence of the first and fourth, with three
starting-points, and one to the combined influence of the first and
third with four starting-points.</p>

<p>The train of associations is inhibited by a new starting-point which
dominates in influence. No mention is made in any note that a former
starting-point remains in consciousness for the series, but M. emphatically
writes, "Absolutely no influence of the preceding word or words
when the next is taken up"; and later, "As soon as the new one is pronounced
the old word and the series it had brought up were immediately
suppressed." Bl. comments, "How remarkable it is that each
new word crowds the old trend of associations out and starts new ones";
and the graphic representation, one of which only is given here on
account of lack of space, shows that there is no return to the original
series.</p>

<p>The tables are indicative of the tendency. In the first division of the
group there are three possible lines of fusion, in the second six possible
lines, and in the third twelve possible lines, but we find only 13.2% for
all forms of fusion in the first, 7.9% for the second, and 10.5% for the
third. In the eighty-seven experiments of the series there is but one
absolute return to the previous starting-point. (See Group IX, sec.
2, Bl.) The tables show the varying degrees of fusion, and while the
percentages have little meaning, as there is a variable time-element,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
the numbers do show accurately the number of words and the
relative and continued influence of each starting-point.</p>

<p>We conclude that, when the present content of consciousness is
a series of associations, the newly given impression establishes itself
sufficiently to inhibit the associations of the previous series.</p>

<p>The aim here was to see if it were possible to have the first starting-point
such that the conditions would be similar to the results obtained
by using preparatory marginal settings, but include rather than inhibit
the second starting-point. A review of the tendency toward mental
combination in the former experiments suggested that the words be in
the relation of the whole and part. The "part" was given the position
of predominating influence in order to see to just what extent it would
persist in combining.</p>

<p>In the light of the interpretation of previous facts and the subsequent
results of this group of experiments, we are now in a position to conclude
that, if the present content of consciousness on the reception of a
new impression is such that the reactions are not antagonistic but reÃ«nforce
each other, the second will not persist in independent influence,
but will be rather included in and supplementary to the influence of
the first, which otherwise would be less assertive. The results below
show that while the first of the two starting-points has a decided disadvantage
of position, and therefore has little influence in arousing associations,
it here is responsible for 43.2% and the second for but 9.5%,
while there is a combined influence of 47.3%, the first strongly predominating
in partial fusion. There is but one case where the second
was followed exclusively.</p>

<p>The explanation of this, extended to an hypothesis, would rest in the
fact that each word has definite characteristic reactions and that the
fusion of two words or lines of thought means that the motor accompaniments
are such that they unite and reÃ«nforce each other, or that
the one includes the other. There are few antagonistic impulses.</p>

<p>In the last group the words were called whole and part, although the
reader no doubt observed that this was not always strictly the case,
but rather that the more complex was more influential as a word-suggester
than the simple and often tended to include it. Can this be
demonstrated in another way? Attention was called in Group of Experiments
IV (two pictures shown) that picture no. 3 (a man sawing
wood), although first, had more than the normal number of associations,
the explanation of which might lie in the fact that it contained more
objects. We here attempt to test this by comparing a comparatively
complex and a comparatively simple picture as starting-points. It has
been clearly proven that the second picture to be presented has a
decided advantage of position. The simple picture is here given the
advantage of position. The notes show the first to be more important,
while there is no suggestion of the first including the second, on account
of there being less fusion than for words and more independent associations
for the second starting-point; the averages are 38.5% for the
first, 30.5% for the second, 31.0% fusion.</p>

<p>Three words spoken, one immediately following the other, are given
in this group in order to test the span of consciousness and the influence
of an immediate interruption, as one was given immediately following
the other in such a way that all associations were checked until
after the third starting-point. If we attempt to follow the initial starting-points
we see they may disappear after the first few associations
and reappear in the series; or each remain as initial starting-points
for a few associations; or one alone control the whole series, while the
others are present without influence; or there may be an alternation
of independent influences; or an influence which shows a modifying
effect of one or both of the other starting-points, which may reach such
a degree that all fuse, and in so doing get an advantage over the single
words. The starting-points are to a large extent disparate and there
is very little fusion; we find only .5% total fusion and 18.7% partial
fusion.</p>

<p>There were no cases of the total fusion of all the starting-points
throughout the series, no cases of total fusion of the first and second,
and two cases for the second and third. There were two cases of
partial fusion of the first, second, and third throughout. The first
was followed exclusively in two cases, the third in one. The first
and third were followed intermittently in four cases, the second and
third in eleven, the first, second, and third in thirty-five.</p>

<p>The second starting-point has the ascendency of influence. This is
not due to habits formed in earlier experiments, as the two groups of
experiments with two words were given in connection with other experiments.
This group informs us that in immediate interruption the new
impression has not sufficient power to establish itself more firmly than
a past impression which is just past, and must in a manner be reproduced
to start associations. The influence of the first has been somewhat
destroyed, but the second is greater than the third.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Number of subjects, 9; number of sections, 6; number of experiments, 52;
number of associations, 751.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span></p>

<p>We ask finally how far our results and notes point to a theoretical
understanding of the mechanism of associations. Previous work, especially
that of James, Cordes, Calkins, and Scripture, as well as the
accumulated notes of my subjects, confirm that the transition may be
made by means of total, partial, and focal recall, and that in partial and
focal recall the prominent persisting elements are surrounded in the
formation of a new idea by other new elements.</p>

<p>If a latent idea remains in the margin of consciousness and exerts
an influence, which not merely modifies but determines the series of
associations, and leads up to the focalisation of the latent idea, we
have a case of predetermined association, which, when noted by investigators,
has invariably become confused with mediate association.
Here there is an element or group of elements, persisting in the margin
of consciousness, which is gradually maturing and becoming focalised
into groups of elements comprising an idea which ultimately dominates
consciousness. In some cases three, four, and five ideas have
been named before this takes place, and we have here a reversed form
of association. Four subjects noted the experience on different occasions,
and it is not to be confused with the common experience of
apprehending the present contents of consciousness as part of a larger
whole where we are conscious of its existence but not of what it is.</p>

<p>The notes further show that the common conscious elements may be
predominantly visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, or kinÃ¦sthetic,
or a complex or compound of these in character, while to this may be
added an indication of the fact that the transition, incipient as it is,
may in many cases be reduced to a condition which is in the last analysis
one of the motor nervous system. Ht., for instance, finds that the
words all pass over into innervations of the organs of speech and "are
accompanied by the impulse to make the sound," stating later, "they
hang on the tongue." The following is one of the series given which
represents rather an extreme case, Taft, taffy, toffy; tough, rough,
ruff; buff, bluff, tough; muff, duff, tuff. Br., who also gave a large
percentage of verbal associations, finds that "some part of each word
seems to linger on the tongue with motor sensations till the next
comes." "I am subject," he adds, "more or less frequently to verbal
automatism of this auditory incipient motor type." Ro., who has many
auditory associations, reports "they are always accompanied by motor
images, together with many associations." A changing of orientation
is a common accompaniment, with statements of the feeling of the
impulse to turn in various directions. For F., who is predominantly
of the motor type, we have an example where the rhythmic ticking of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>
a clock fades into the rhythmic watching of a boat rising and falling
on the water.</p>

<p>The notes would seem to indicate that there is no idea without a
motor fringe, and also that these elements of incipient impulses to
movement may accompany the elements of transition, and are observed
introspectively by the subjects. They are therefore data for
psychology. Do they influence or direct the associations? In short,
are they the processes which connect and which determine the associations?</p>

<p>F. states, "There seem to have been waves of motor sensations.
Such waves may start with a word and carry one in faint mimicry
through the whole succession of bodily sensations that one experienced
in that event, and then may come a relapse until other stronger
currents appear." Here we are face to face with the dynamics of association,
the most fundamental and important problem of brain association.
Have these phenomena of ideational images "acquired by contact
a kind of magnetism which causes the one to attract the other and
have, so to speak, become magnetic?" (Zanotti.) Or are they on the
other hand independent of all force and "merely ideas of antecedence
and sequence only?" (Mill.) While there is no mention of a magnetic
force, the notes and results all show that the ideas are systematically
conditioned in a way which cannot be explained by the contiguity
of the objects. The motor elements play the deciding role. Ht.
emphasises the influence of ideated movement when he writes, "KinÃ¦sthetic.
Slow regular tramping on snowshoes brought up the characteristic
swing of arms, and therewith the idea (sensations of weight)
of the stick (or stock) which I have generally carried on Norwegian
snowshoes. Transition from Vermont to the Black Forest by association
with snowshoeing in both places. Real sensations in play were
free breath, movements in chest (kinÃ¦sthetic), fresh air (olfactory),
cold (thermal), and emotion of emotional strength." Again, "Looking
up at sun suggested general ideas of expansion of attention and
with this breath comes the idea, breezes"; another subject adds,
"A tendency to imitate the sounds of syllables and this leads on to
a train of associations"; another, "A slight feeling of sudden changed
impulse"; another, "A sort of motor after-image came back and
took the foreground"; and F. goes further when he states, "Ideationally
my hand wandered to the upper right-hand corner of the
page, then suddenly the auditory image of 47 came up as if whispered
to me." All of which indicate that some ideas at least depend
for their entrance into consciousness upon motor reactions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span></p>

<p>Passing to the more refined reactions expressed in emotions we find
that they are not merely accompanying coloring influences, but also
often actual determining factors. All of the subjects notice at some
time a coloring atmosphere from an emotion, but others find that "the
growing word is rather felt emotionally than definitely formulated,"
and we have "a nameless idea, largely feeling-tone" (Ht.); or the words
may "all come as parts of a growing feeling, an indistinct though
strong state of mind." (J.) The same subject observed, "The previous
word may create a mood or feeling which in the main determines
the associations; a group of words is dependent upon strong accompanying
feeling&mdash;there is a summation and a discharge while
the next word has been accumulating force" (J.), and we have a form
of summation; or in other words, "a general mood accumulated while
several words were in mind at once, then all dropped and another
general feeling came to the front with an accumulation of other
words." (F.) Here we have a typical example of constellation where
all the words and ideas are implicitly present as a total attitude or
disposition, the elements of which become successively focalised into
a series of associated images. The last subject finds that "the emotional
atmosphere often controls the associations." Indeed, it would
seem that occasionally for some subjects this strong accompanying
undercurrent of undifferentiated emotional feeling is capable of bringing
about trains of thought independent of any logical connection.
K. finds "the feeling to carry one on"; H. finds the "point of departure
the interesting idea"; all find that the words change with the disposition,
as may be verified by a study of the lists of associations.</p>

<p>We are forced to conclude that the impulses to movement or other
emotional attitudes may act as determining factors in association,
which extended to an hypothesis would mean that the mode
of transition in the associated series is in the last analysis to be
found in delicate incipient motor tendencies to action, the psychic
concomitants of which are observable; that psychic states are both
as to their unity and organisation consequences of motor reactions
which are implicitly present as parts of a total reaction to the
present situation. It is these motor tendencies to action which determine
what idea shall enter consciousness. Just in so far as they
become released they become prolonged, accentuated, and form a
nucleus for the new idea. To speak of association independent of
motor elements is merely to make an empirical classification of successive
states of consciousness.</p>

<p>There remains a psychical phenomenon which must be satisfactorily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
accounted for before we go farther. An element of an idea, an idea or
a series of ideas may occupy consciousness to the exclusion of others.
If the second starting-point were not given, the associations would undoubtedly
follow the given one. Inhibition must then be one form of
"obstructed association," the inhibiting ideas being present to the exclusion
of the inhibited. But are we thus forced to say inhibition is the
"negative side of the association process," claiming that all ideas not
in consciousness are inhibited, and thus being forced to conclude the
conscious idea is inhibiting an unconscious idea, which cannot exist
(by the very definition and presuppositions of psychology) until it is
an object of consciousness. This would mean that content of consciousness
and inhibition are identical. On the other hand, the notes and
exemplifying facts of the tables show Dr. Breese's fallacious position
when he concludes that "because, obeying the laws of association, the
train of ideas takes one direction rather than another can hardly be
considered sufficient ground to hold that the other possible train of
ideas is inhibited."<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> He has overlooked the possibility of two or more
trains of associations having been started and the associations of one
starting-point are excluded from entering the focus of consciousness
by the direction of the given series. Inhibition would then be the negative
side of fusion. The explanation must, as has already been demonstrated,
be psycho-physical in character. If these impulses to action
have actually been observed by the subjects we are justified in concluding
that just as in physiological inhibition one action excludes another,
so the correlative tendencies to movement of one idea exclude others.</p>

<p>By. observed that the image of the starting-point lingered and inhibited
subsequent ideas. The implication here, from our previous
reasoning, would be that not the ideational images, as such, but the
physiological motor concomitants, persisted and excluded others, and
this is why disparate terms give a "shock to the nervous system" (A.),
"require different lines of expression" (A.); and "one has more momentum,"
as so many report. This would explain why the associations
of a new starting-point inhibit the associations of a former one; for
as the motor nervous impulses tend to work themselves out into
action, the reaction of the previous impulse will be suppressed by
those of a new impulse which enters, by the conditions of these experiments,
an attentive consciousness. Thus the prepotent impulses
to action are the conditioning factors in mental inhibition.</p>

<p>All this indicates that the basis of habit which has been the
universal principle of explanation of associations is inadequate. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>
MÃ¼nsterberg has pointed out, contrary to what we mean by habit,
either idea may bring to consciousness the other, in a manner independent
of the order of the original presentation. Extending our hypothesis
to include the formation of associations, the conclusion will
be that in order for two ideas to become associated they must be
together in consciousness, each as parts of a total experience, a
total attitude; the motor reactions of the ideas must be parts of a
more comprehensive reaction which includes both as simultaneous
correlated motor impulses: when, in future time, the reactions of the
one are reÃ«xperienced, there is a sequence of infinitely delicate and
complex impulses to movement, and any tendency toward such
reaction tends to reproduce the whole of which it is a part, as each
reaction is more or less bound up in the integrity of the whole central
nervous system.</p>

<h2><a name="DISSOCIATION" id="DISSOCIATION"></a>DISSOCIATION</h2>

<p class="p1b">BY C. H. TOLL</p>


<p>T<span class="smcapa">HE</span> purpose of this investigation, of which the following gives
a preliminary report, was to compare the tendency to associate by
contiguity, with the tendency to associate by similarity.</p>

<p>In every series of stimuli to which one gives attention there is tendency
to association by contiguity. But some similarity among certain
elements of the series may produce a dissociation of the given elements
into two series with some bond of similarity in each. This is
a matter of common experience, as when you find you can read your
newspaper and listen to your neighbors' conversation at the same
time, understanding both, although the actual order in which the
several words are perceived would form a meaningless mixture.</p>

<p>We may say dissociation is always accomplished by a tendency to
association by similarity overcoming the constant tendency to association
by contiguity. Study of the relative efficacy of the two may
therefore be called a study of dissociation. The tendency to associate
by contiguity might be measured in two ways.</p>

<p>First, when one attempts to learn a series in exactly the given
order, the number of errors in the series as recollected may be taken
as an inverse indication of the strength of association by contiguity.
The three kinds of error possible in nearly all of the experiments
were Omissions, Displacements, and Imperfections. All of these three
have been tabulated. But the number of elements omitted seems
considerably the most reliable as an indication of the degree of
inadequacy of the associative tendency. The cases of displaced or
imperfect elements are comparatively few: moreover, Displacements
and Imperfections are not mutually exclusive categories. A single
element may be both imperfectly recollected and wrongly placed in
the recollected series. On the whole, it seems that the number of given
elements which were omitted in the recalled series is the most positive
and reliable of the errors. Our conclusions are based on the Omissions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span></p>

<p>Second, when one makes no attempt to learn the series, simply
giving attention to each element as it comes, and afterward lets the
elements recur spontaneously, the number of cases in which a recollected
element is followed by an element given contiguously may be
taken as a direct indication of the strength of association by contiguity.</p>

<p>Tendency to association by similarity can evidently be measured
in the same two ways, by counting errors when one purposes to learn
the series as two groups of similar elements, and by counting sequences
of similar elements when one avoids any effort to learn the series and
recollection is spontaneous.</p>

<p>In the first seven experiments we used the first method. The
errors made when the purpose is to associate by contiguity can then
be compared with the errors made when the purpose is to associate
by similarity, an equal number of series, given under the same conditions,
and of identical character, being given in each case.</p>

<p>In the last four experiments we have used the second method. The
number of sequences of elements given contiguously can then be
compared with the number of sequences of similar elements.</p>

<p>Five subjects have coÃ¶perated in this, but the experiments were
strictly individual, one observer being alone in the room with the
experimenter. Each test lasted about an hour. As a matter of
course, the results have been calculated for each of the five subjects
and their agreements and disagreements have been carefully
considered. But as this first report is to indicate merely the general
tendency, we give here at first only the average of the five persons.</p>

<p>The experiments have varied as to the kind of elements used, the
manner of presentation, the time allowed, and the manner of recording
the recollected series. But throughout each experiment the series
were of one identical type, while the individual elements were altered
in each series.</p>

<p>In the experiments where the series were to be learned, some in
the given order, some dissociated by similarity, it was found rather
confusing to turn from one method to the other; so several consecutive
series were learned by one method, and then several by the other,
four alternations being made each hour to neutralize any effect of
practice or of fatigue.</p>

<p>The series were of course different in kind in the several experiments,
but were usually of eight or of ten elements. Half of this
number had some distinct characteristic in common, the other half
some other characteristic. In some experiments these elements were
alternated, in some arranged irregularly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span></p>

<p>In the first eight experiments the subject wrote down the elements
recalled, as soon as the series had been given. In the last three the
subject spoke the elements recalled.</p>

<p>In all cases where the first method of measurement was used, the
time allowed for learning the series was made a little too short to
permit of learning the series perfectly. Since comparison of the number
of mistakes was our method, we naturally had to make sure there
would be mistakes to compare.</p>

<p>The details of the several experiments were as follows:</p>

<p>(1) The elements were letters and numbers. They were about
12Ã8 mm. in size and were printed on white cards 15Ã30 mm.</p>

<p>Five letters and five numbers were placed, alternately, in a straight
row on a sheet of white cardboard. The series was then exposed to
the subject by turning up the small tin shutter of a screen that was
clamped to the table-edge.</p>

<p>The time of exposure was measured with a stop-watch and was
constant throughout the hour for each individual subject. Four seconds
proved the best time for most of them, but in one case it was
necessary to allow only three seconds. Twenty series were presented
during each hour, ten for each method of memorizing. There were
duplicates of all the numbers, and of eight letters, but not more than
two of any element. Selection in forming the series was by chance.
In dissociating, the letters were separated from the numbers.</p>

<p>As soon as the exposure was ended, the subject wrote down the
elements recollected, trying to preserve their relative order. This
recollected list was then copied beside the operator's record of the
given series, so making the errors apparent.</p>

<p>(2) The elements were all letters, printed as before, and the alternate
cards were placed half their length out of alignment with the
original row.</p>

<p>The method of presentation, the length of exposure, the number
of elements presented, etc., were as in no. 1. In dissociating, the letters
on one level were separated from those on the other.</p>

<p>(3) The elements were all letters, printed as before, and five of
the ten elements presented were placed out of alignment. But the disaligned
cards were at irregular intervals and often in groups, and
were only a quarter of an inch out of alignment. This order was
varied each time, but without any system.</p>

<p>The other details were as in no. 1.</p>

<p>During this experiment I came to notice the effect produced by the
natural tendency to learn the five elements of the dissociated series<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
in a rhythmical form, thereby increasing the ability to retain them;
while there appeared to be no natural tendency to apply any such
inclusive rhythm to the ten elements of the series when learned in
the given order. To counteract this effect the subjects were instructed
to consider the series, when learned in the given order, as two consecutive
series of five elements each, and to use the same natural
rhythm in learning these as they did in the dissociating. But this
correction was not made in the first two hours, nor very perfectly in
the rest.</p>

<p>(4) The elements were all numbers, printed as before, five of the
ten being placed a quarter of an inch out of alignment, and in irregular
groups, precisely as in the last experiment.</p>

<p>The time was reduced to three seconds for some and two seconds
for the others. Details of presentation were as described in no. 1.</p>

<p>This time all the subjects tried to neutralize the effect of the instinctive
rhythm for the five-element series by learning the ten-element
series in two groups of five elements each.</p>

<p>(5) The elements were all nonsense syllables, each consisting of
a vowel between two consonants, printed on white cards 20Ã20 mm.
Eight of these were placed in an even row on a sheet of white cardboard,
and four of them were marked by laying a quarter-inch strip
of blue paper over the bottom of the card. The serial position of
the marked cards was irregular, and was altered each time.</p>

<p>Ten seconds was given to some subjects, eight to the others. Other
details of exposure, etc., were as in no. 1.</p>

<p>In learning the series in the given order, the blue markings were
ignored; but in dissociating, the marked and unmarked syllables were
learned in separate groups.</p>

<p>There seemed to be no rhythmical tendency; but to be safe the
subjects were instructed to learn the straight series in groups of fours.</p>

<p>Seven series were given to be learned in each method during the
hour with each subject.</p>

<p>(6) The elements were one-syllable nouns, alternated with nonsense
syllables, all spoken by the operator. The nonsense syllables
were all different from those used in the preceding experiment: the
nouns were ordinary words, and were so arranged as to avoid any
obvious sequence or relation among them. Very few, if any, were
used twice in one hour. Five nouns and five syllables were given in
each series.</p>

<p>The elements were spoken at the rate of forty-six a minute, timed
by a metronome which was muffled in a heavily padded box so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>
its sound was no disturbing factor. The speaker sat within three feet
of the subject and enunciated as distinctly as possible.</p>

<p>Dissociation was performed as previously: in each hour eight
series were dissociated, and eight learned in the given order.</p>

<p>(7) The elements were one-syllable nouns, spoken as before, alternated
with nonsense syllables, printed on small white cards. The
nouns were all different from those used in the previous experiment:
the nonsense syllables were the same, but were this time printed, in
letters 10 mm. high, on cards 40 mm. square. They were exposed
by sliding them, one at a time, in front of an opening in a cardboard
screen which was fastened to the table-edge.</p>

<p>The optimum rate for presenting the elements was found to be
about forty a minute, measured with the metronome.</p>

<p>Five nouns and five nonsense syllables were given in each series.
Eight series were given to be learned in the given order, and eight
to be dissociated into separate series of nouns and of syllables.</p>

<p>(8) The elements were names of mammals, alternated with names
of cities of the United States, all spoken. The names were all fairly
familiar. Ten elements were given in each series.</p>

<p>The interval in reading was planned to be long enough for some
appreciation of the meaning of the words, but not enough to permit
mental repetition of the preceding elements. Any mechanical time-measurement
was found impracticable.</p>

<p>The subjects were instructed to avoid any effort to memorize the
series, simply receiving each element as given.</p>

<p>After the last element there was a pause of about two seconds,
to decrease the mere sound-recollection of the last few elements.
Then the operator repeated, in an altered tone, one of the given elements.
The subject at once wrote down the first element that came
to mind, then the next, and so on.</p>

<p>In the seven preceding experiments the set of series presented
had been different for each subject, though of course identical in
character. But in this experiment and the following ones the lists
of words were identical as read to each subject. The same element
was repeated for each. Sixteen lists were given.</p>

<p>(9) The elements were nouns. In each series five names of similar
objects were alternated with five names of a different sort of objects,
<em>e. g.</em>, names of fishes with names of poets. All were read, as before.
In each series new sorts of objects were chosen. The subject never
knew what sort of words were to be given; the subjects agreed this
was not a disturbing factor to them, and it obviated the tendency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>
to think what words would probably be given, as is natural when the
general character of the series is announced beforehand.</p>

<p>The subjects were instructed to be passive during the reading, and
during the four-second pause that followed, avoiding mental repetition
of the words. Then the operator gave a signal and the subject
repeated aloud the words as they happened to be remembered. The
words being numbered on the list from which they were read, the
operator was able to record the words as fast as spoken.</p>

<p>The subjects were instructed to give the word which they found
to be foremost after they had spoken the preceding one, rather than
to try to repeat a group of words which usually appeared simultaneously
at the first effort of recollection, but which usually faded
while one of them was being spoken.</p>

<p>The same sixteen series, of ten elements each, were given to each
subject.</p>

<p>(10) The elements were nouns, the ten presented in each series
all being names of similar objects, <em>e. g.</em>, flowers. Five were spoken,
alternated with five printed on small cards which were shoved in
front of a 10Ã10 cm. opening in a cardboard screen fastened to the
table-edge. Cards were 40 mm. square, the words printed by hand,
but carefully, in letters 10 mm. high.</p>

<p>A series was given in about 13 seconds, but the time was not
mechanically measured; it was at a rate which some practice showed
to give a fair time to comprehend each element.</p>

<p>As before, the subjects were told to be passive until, after a four-second
pause at the end of the series, the operator gave a signal.
Then the recollected words were spoken.</p>

<p>The class of nouns was different in each series.</p>

<p>(11) The elements were nouns. In each series five of some familiar
class were alternated with five of some other familiar class. The
classes were different in each of the twelve series given.</p>

<p>From this regular series of ten, five were chosen irregularly, and
were printed on cards as in no. 9. The remaining five, of course also
irregularly placed in the series, were spoken. This irregularity was
different in each series. Thus some words of one kind were spoken,
the rest printed; some words of the other kind were spoken, the rest
printed.</p>

<p>The other conditions were exactly as in the last experiment.</p>

<p>The results by the first method of measurement may be summarized
as follows, though the first and third conclusions are weakened
by disagreement among the individual subjects.</p>

<p><em>A.</em> When the only dissociating factor is some slight unessential<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>
feature (a bit of color on the card, a slight disalignment), this similarity
and contiguity are nearly equally efficient. No. 3 and no. 5.</p>

<p>As this unessential feature is made more striking (disalignment
half a card-length), the strength of similarity increases, only three
fourths as many errors being made in dissociation as in contiguous
association. No. 2.</p>

<p>The case of no. 4 (all numbers) is of little or no value. The time
allowed for learning had to be made short enough to ensure the
appearance of some errors; perfect recollection would obviously give
no basis for comparison. And the time had to be so short in this case
(only two seconds for some of the subjects) that the additional eye-motions
and adjustments necessary in dissociating took time enough
to spoil the results.</p>

<p><em>B.</em> When the only dissociating factor is in the meaning of the elements
(letters and numbers), this similarity is stronger than contiguity,
only one half as many errors being made. No. 1.</p>

<p>The results of no. 6 do not support this proportion, but its results
are not consistent, while those of no. 1 are.</p>

<p><em>C.</em> When both meaning and manner of presentation are combined
as dissociating factors (nouns and nonsense syllables, seen and
heard), this similarity is stronger than contiguity, only three fourths
as many errors being made.</p>

<p>But this method of measurement is not well adapted to series of
auditory elements, so this experiment is unsatisfactory. No. 7.</p>

<p>The results by the second method of measurement may be summarized
as follows:</p>

<p><em>A.</em> When the only dissociating factor is in the meaning of the elements
(names of different sorts of objects), this similarity is stronger
than contiguity, twice as many similarity sequences as contiguity
sequences being recalled. No. 8 and no. 9.</p>

<p><em>B.</em> When the only dissociating factor is in the manner of presentation
(to sight and hearing), this similarity is stronger than contiguity,
nearly three times as many similarity sequences being recalled. No. 10.</p>

<p><em>C.</em> When both meaning and manner of presentation are dissociating
factors, these similarities are much stronger than contiguity,
more than four times as many similarity sequences being recalled.</p>

<p><em>D.</em> When these two dissociating factors are opposed to each other:
(1) Four of the subjects show similarity of meaning much stronger
than similarity of presentation, from two to five times as many similarity-of-meaning
sequences being recalled. (2) One subject is
strongly and consistently otherwise, giving nearly three times as
many similarity-of-presentation sequences. No. 11.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_ACCURACY_OF_LINEAR_MOVEMENT" id="THE_ACCURACY_OF_LINEAR_MOVEMENT"></a>THE ACCURACY OF LINEAR MOVEMENT</h2>

<p class="p1b">BY B.A. LENFEST</p>


<p>T<span class="smcapa">HE</span> starting-point for our investigation was the observation of
Woodworth<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> that there is a certain rhythm in which a certain hand-movement
is made with the maximum of exactitude, and which
represents thus an optimum for the periodical discharge of the particular
motor centre. Our question was whether this rhythm is a
constant one for all parts of the body, or whether different groups
of muscles produce the greatest exactitude in different periods; further,
whether secondary factors, like complexity of movement, resistance
by weight, fatigue, etc., influence this psycho-physiological
optimum.</p>

<p>The investigation, however, showed soon the necessity to consider
the whole problem of the accuracy of rhythmical linear movements,
and the experiments are thus not always directly related to
our starting-point.</p>

<p>There is very little material published that can be collected under
the subject head, accuracy of voluntary movement, and still less
when the enquiry is confined to the accuracy of straight lines or linear
movements.</p>

<p>The most suggestive contribution is that of Dr. Woodworth on
the accuracy of voluntary movement. He has collected consistently
what can be found up to the date of his publication, and the reader
is referred to pages 7-16 of his monograph for the most reliable collection
of authorities.</p>

<p>It must be said, as we run over the list from Goldscheider on the
threshold of perceptible movement, through the results of Hall, Hartwell,
Loeb, and Delabarre on "bilateral asymmetry" and comparisons
of right and left hands; consider Fullerton and Cattell in their
suggestive results, and MÃ¼nsterberg's studies of movements; and
finally take the testimony of Bryan as to the growth of accuracy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>
movement in children, that the vast accumulation of material bearing
on reaction time&mdash;and similar phenomena would be of more value
if concerned more with the accuracy and less with the production
or perception of movement.</p>

<p>A paper by Miss M. K. Smith, in the Philosophische Studien for
1900, with the title, Rhythmus und Arbeit, concerns the influence of
rhythmical action upon the quality and quantity of work performed.
The method was to commit to memory nonsense syllables and
letters.</p>

<p>The results show a tendency to take up a certain rhythm, especially
in the later results and after practice; easier memorizing if rhythm
is present; motor reactions, as tapping, nodding, or swaying of body
are noted frequently; the feeling of pleasure accompanies rhythmic
reactions. While there are no data as to accuracy, there is suggestive
matter bearing on the optimal rate and on the relations of compound
and simple movements of the hand.</p>

<p>As far as the writer knows, he is the first to present systematic
results as to the head and foot movement. The purposes of this
enquiry may be briefly stated as</p>

<p>(1) the collection of a large body of facts, bearing on the actual
and relative accuracy of straight-line movements possible with various
parts of the body, such as hands, arms, head, legs, and feet;</p>

<p>(Something like 340,000 lines have been drawn and calculated.)</p>

<p>(2) to introduce certain variations in the conditions attending the
production of ruled lines, such as</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) to rule with the eyes opened and eyes closed, with other conditions
the same;</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) to change the rate of ruling or interval between the production
of ruled lines; the rates chosen were 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 100,
120, 140, 160, 180, and 200 beats per minute;</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) to change the length of the normal or first line; the lengths
used were 14, 10, and 1 cm.;</p>

<p>(<em>d</em>) to impose a weight on the ruling hand to either retard or accelerate
the movement, choosing a weight of such magnitude that
it would be perceptible, but would not have mass enough to cause
pain or fatigue; 260 grams was used;</p>

<p>(<em>e</em>) to introduce a simultaneous movement of the free hand; <em>i. e.</em>,
the one that did not carry the recording pencil, of a similar character
and extent but of opposite direction to the ruling hand;</p>

<p>(<em>f</em>) to record movements of both hands, of the head and of both
feet;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span></p>

<p>(<em>g</em>) to conduct a series of experiments of similar character, as regards
time-rate and extent of movement, to the series presented by
Dr. Woodworth, with the idea of corroborating or disproving the
results of his investigations; lines of 140 cm. were accordingly chosen;</p>

<p>(<em>h</em>) to conduct a series of experiments where the subject chooses his
own rhythm or rate at which the easiest and best lines, subjectively
speaking, could be ruled;</p>

<p>(<em>i</em>) to find the rates of respiration and pulse-beats and find the
connection, if any, between them and the linear records.</p>

<p>(3) To examine, by variations of the number of lines ruled, the
questions of fatigue and persistence of the memory-image; series of
50 lines for the first year and of 20 lines for the second year, were
accordingly selected.</p>

<p>(4) To find the relations, if any, between constant errors and mean
variations, so called.</p>


<p class="p6">T<span class="smcapa">HE</span> A<span class="smcapa">PPARATUS</span></p>

<p>It is proposed to give the briefest possible discussion or explanation
of the apparatus required for the investigation, it being desired
at a later stage to enter into a comparison of the method adopted
here with that of the only other investigation at all comparable to
this one: the research problem of Dr. Woodworth, already referred
to.</p>

<p>The underlying principle has been to avoid complication in apparatus,
partly because of the delay and expense involved in working
out, and making up elaborate schemes for apparatus, but mainly
because of the advantage in duplicating this series of experiments,
or of carrying on related investigations, to be derived from a choice
of such parts, entering into the complete apparatus, as are at hand
in any psychological laboratory, or that can be obtained and set up
at small expense.</p>

<p>The use of smoked paper has been avoided, because a short preliminary
series, using the usual smoked-paper records, was found to
give no better results than did the method here adopted of ruling
on white paper with a soft pencil, and the labor was thus considerably
reduced.</p>

<p>To the objection that the pencil-ruling is more difficult, and involves
more loss in friction and more complicated adjustments on
the part of the subjects, only one of fourteen subjects admits that
this is the case; and even if the testimony was unanimous as to the
greater ease of production of the smoked records, it would be no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>
reason for its adoption, since one of the first rules for all experimental
work is uniformity of conditions, and this is equally well attained in
either case.</p>

<p>The apparatus for free hand-movements and for the compound
movements of both hands consists:</p>

<p>(1) Of an adjustable wooden rest (see Fig. <em>A</em>) with a base (<em>a</em>) about
40 Ã 60 cm. hinged to a vertically adjustable flat board (<em>b</em>), called the
arm-rest, about 40 Ã 70 cm., and having on its upper edge two brass
pins or plates (<em>c</em>) about 30 cm. apart.</p>

<p>The pencil is started from one of these pins, depending on the hand
used, and moved until it comes in contact with a wooden rod that is
held against the opposite pin and which is of the right length to give
a movement of the pencil of 1, 10, or 14 cm., as desired.</p>

<p>The operator holds this rod in place for the first line ruled and then
instantly removes it, so that the second and all later lines are ruled
by memory of the first one, as closely in length to the first, or so-called
normal line, as is possible.</p>

<p>(2) The apparatus for actuating and taking care of the paper.</p>

<p>This consists of two drums (<em>d</em> and <em>dÂ´</em>, Fig. <em>B</em>) 20 cm. diameter
by 40 cm. wide, mounted on suitable supports about 1 metre apart,
and fastened to a table, with axes parallel.</p>

<p>The drum upon which the record is to be made (<em>d</em>) is adjusted
close to the arm-rest, so that each ruled line will be carried down
and out of sight before the next one is ruled, the pencil being held in
the position (<em>e</em>); note that the arrow shows the direction of rotation.</p>

<p>The second drum (<em>dÂ´</em>) is actuated by a motor (<em>F</em>) through a round
belt (<em>g</em>), this motor being a clockwork type, with gear-changes and
adjustable vanes for varying the speed, and having the power derived
from a suspended weight (<em>w</em>).</p>

<p>The recording paper (<em>h</em>) transmits motion from (<em>dÂ´</em>) to (<em>d</em>). This
paper consists of a strip about six metres long by twenty-eight cm.
wide, with one end pasted to (<em>d</em>), and then wound upon (<em>d</em>), leaving
enough to be carried to (<em>dÂ´</em>) and pasted to the latter. As the paper
is unwound from (<em>d</em>), it is wound upon (<em>dÂ´</em>), and, both to keep the paper
tight and to prevent too rapid unwinding of (<em>d</em>), it is necessary to apply
a friction-brake to the shaft of (<em>d</em>).</p>

<p>(3) A metronome, capable of being used for a range of 20 to
200 beats, and a stop-watch, to enable the operator correctly to time
the subject, are in constant use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489"></a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img  src="images/i_489.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span></p>

<p>The metronome is set in vibration and the subject is permitted
to take his own time to start the ruling, the operator holding the
wooden rod in place with one hand, while the other hand holds the
stop-watch ready to start it the instant the subject's pencil is moved.
There is thus a personal equation for the length of period, but this is
of no consequence, as will be apparent when the method of calculation
and the use of the planimeter is considered.</p>

<p>In the series of records with the weight, it is impossible to run the
speed about 80 to 100 beats, unless the modification in apparatus
shown in Fig. <em>C</em> is used; for the vibration of the string running
from the hand to the weight around a pulley is violent enough
either to throw the string off the pulley or cause the weight to jump
so severely as to render the records useless.</p>

<p>This is entirely obviated by the given method of using a heavy
weight acting with a small leverage (about 1 cm.) and thus moving
only a short distance, so that it is capable of operating at the highest
speeds with no perceptible shock or jump; the string is led to the
hand or wrist from a grooved pulley of about 12 cm. radius, so the
highest velocity of the weight is only about one twelfth that of the
hand. This method makes it possible to carry the weighted records
to the highest speeds.</p>

<p>This same method is used for the head and foot records, with the
following additional apparatus; the string (Fig. <em>C</em>), shown leading
to the hand, is led horizontally over to and around a similar large
pulley on the opposite side of the table and either down to the foot
or in a diagonally upward direction to the head; so that movements
of the head or foot are faithfully recorded on the drum by means of
a pencil held in a block of wood, this block of wood being fastened
on the horizontal string in a suitable position for recording on the
drum paper. The pencil is kept against the paper by a light spring
or elastic band.</p>

<p>The foot is connected to the string by a stirrup that prevents any
movement of the feet at all, unless the same is recorded by the pencil.</p>

<p>The head is furnished with a skull cap or harness consisting of
non-elastic webbing and stiffened, where the string is attached, by a
strip of sheet brass formed to fit the forehead or the back of the head,
as the case may be. The object of the brass strip is to prevent a lost
motion in the flexible webbing, that is found troublesome otherwise.</p>

<p>It will be evident, then, that the weight is continually acting as an
accelerating or retarding influence in all records for head and feet, but
it is not considered objectionable, for it is a constant throughout the
series.</p>

<p>The other plan would require a circuit of cord leading in both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>
directions from the head or feet in a complete circuit, and would cause
in the opinion of the writer too much complication of apparatus.</p>

<p>The pulse-beats were taken by the stop-watch and wrist method so
familiar to the physician, while the respiration results were obtained
by the usual tambour apparatus for registering the chest expansion
upon smoked paper.</p>


<p class="p6">T<span class="smcapa">HE</span> M<span class="smcapa">ETHOD</span> <span class="smcapa">OF</span> C<span class="smcapa">ALCULATION</span></p>

<p>Suppose that the drums have been set in rotation and that the paper
is unwinding from (<em>d</em>) and being wound on (<em>dÂ´</em>), Fig. <em>B</em>, and suppose
that the subject has ruled series of 20 to 50 lines, as may be desired,
regulated by the stop-watch in the hands of the operator. The records
will appear much as Fig. 5 under the planimeter discussion, there
being for each speed one normal line to start and a series of lines
following and intended to be of the same length as the normal line.
A series of records, then, consists of 13 records of 20 or 50 lines, each
running from 20 to 200 beats per minute, the complete series having
not less than 260 and not more than 650 lines.</p>

<p>It should be added that the operator holds a pencil-point on the
end of each normal line just after the record of 20 or 50 lines is made
and turns the drum (<em>d</em>), thus marking a line nearly perpendicular
to the ruled lines and at the average or normal distance from the
starting-point; an absolutely correct record would show all ruled lines
ending on this line.</p>

<p>The calculation of this series of records by the ordinary method of
measuring each line, adding the lines of the series, averaging for the
constant error, and repeating the operation in a slightly different
form for the mean error or mean variation is of such enormous labor
for an extended investigation as to be beyond the capacity of one or
of several students; it is fortunate that the planimeter is at hand to
be employed in averaging each series, and this instrument has therefore
been selected as overcoming this difficulty.</p>

<p>It is desirable to consider the method employed by Dr. Woodworth
to overcome this danger of excessive computation, and it will now
be subjected to a critical and comparative examination.</p>

<p>He says, page 19 of his monograph on the Accuracy of Voluntary
Movement, that the subject's sole duty was to make the present line
equal to that immediately preceding, and the width of the slot was
so adjusted that the subject could see only the line just ruled. After
discussing certain matters of memory and its relation to the memory-image,
in the attempt to support this changing normal plan, he confesses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span>
on page 20, that this device is advantageous in much simplifying
the most tedious part of the graphic method, that of computation.</p>

<p>While this is undoubtedly true, it needs careful scrutiny before
adoption, for, on the same page, he says that one source of error in
the method of making each line equal to the preceding one is that the
different movements in the same series are not comparable, but
the positive constant error is cumulative in its effect, and the normal
tends to become longer and longer.</p>

<p>Some relation between this source of error and such a record as
shown on page 29, Fig. 2, is evident, for, while it should be noted
that this cumulative effect is peculiar to a series of lines for one speed,
it has further a tendency to produce overruling at all speeds, and the
natural result is to increase the error unduly and unnaturally for the
higher speeds or as the speed increases, because there is then less
time for the discrimination and choice that will tend to shorten the
ruled line. It may be predicted, then, that Dr. Woodworth's method
will show a slight lengthening of normal between lines at slow speeds
and a much greater one at high speeds, the effect being to introduce
a variable factor that would have no existence were a better plan
adopted. The computation required for the average error is simple,
being dependent only on the first and last lines of a series, and it is
suspected that this very simplicity has led to its adoption and the
consequent neglect of certain serious sources of error.</p>

<p>He tells us, on page 20, that the constant and variable error may
well be isolated and studied separately, but indicates that they must
"somehow" be considered combined as nature has made them; that
is, analysis is desirable, but the synthetic method is more scientific.</p>

<p>This investigation will present data suggesting that</p>

<p>(1) Such a curve as that on page 29 of his monograph is not a characteristic
one and relations of length of ruled line, as well as effects
of weight, make it impossible to apply Weber's law or even the law
of Fullerton and Cattell in the way proposed by Dr. Woodworth.</p>

<p>(2) There is no relation, mathematical or other, between constant
and mean errors, and they not only may be but must be isolated
and studied separately, if an investigation is to be conducted in the
interests of scientific exactness.</p>

<p>It will be necessary to reject the method of Dr. Woodworth if the
most reliable results are desired, in which case the planimeter is a
necessity.</p>

<p>The theory of the planimeter cannot be developed at this place;
every physicist and engineer is acquainted with it. The writer believes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>
he was the first to apply the planimeter to the calculation of results
from psycho-physical data for averaging both mean and variable
errors. More than 340,000 lines were involved, each demanding two
measurements. The best type of planimeter for general use and
the one used here is the Amsler adjustable-arm form.</p>

<p>In Fig. <em>D</em> is shown a record taken at twenty beats per minute that
will both explain the method of computation and show how the
planimeter has been used to find the constant and mean errors.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img  src="images/i_493.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="caption">Fig. D</p></div>
</div>

<p>The record, as made and ready for computation, is not provided
with the line <em>cd</em> or with the dotted lines that connect the ends of the
ruled lines. The line <em>ab</em> is drawn by turning the drum of the apparatus
with a pencil held at the end of the normal or left-hand line <em>af</em>, which
was here 100 mm. long.</p>

<p>The tracing-point of the planimeter being placed at <em>a</em>, a reading is
taken, which was in this case 1486; after following with the tracing-point
the dotted path to <em>g</em> and returning, via <em>gb</em> and <em>ba</em>, a second reading
is taken, which was 1248; subtracting gives 238, which should be
read 2380 square mm. for the area of the space <em>agba</em>; dividing by the
distance <em>ab</em>, in this case 119 mm., gives the average height, which is
+ 20.0 mm., the plus sign suggesting that the distance thus found,
which is the constant error for the series, be laid off in addition to or
beyond <em>Fa</em>.</p>

<p>This being done, a line <em>cd</em> is drawn parallel to and 20.0 mm. from
<em>ab</em>, as the mean line of constant errors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span></p>

<p>To find the mean error of the series a slightly different method is
necessary.</p>

<p>Place the tracing-point of the planimeter at <em>c</em> and read vernier,
giving 1916; follow the dotted path from <em>c</em> to <em>h</em>, the straight line
from <em>h</em> to <em>i</em>, the dotted path from <em>i</em> to <em>k</em>, the straight line from <em>k</em> to <em>l</em>,
the dotted path from <em>l</em> to <em>m</em>, the straight lines from <em>m</em> to <em>n</em> and <em>n</em> to <em>g</em>,
the dotted path from <em>g</em> to <em>m</em>, the straight line from <em>m</em> to <em>l</em>, the dotted
path from <em>l</em> to <em>k</em>, the straight line from <em>k</em> to <em>i</em>, the dotted path from <em>i</em> to
<em>n</em>, and the straight line from <em>h</em> to <em>c</em>, when a second reading is taken,
which was in this case, 1806. Divide the difference of these two readings,
1100 mm., by the length of <em>cd</em>, 119 mm., and the result is 9.1 mm.,
or the mean error (mean variation).</p>

<p>It will be noted that this method gives the sum of the errors from
the mean line <em>cd</em>; that is, the same result would be obtained if the
tracing-point were (1) carried from <em>c</em> around all the area below <em>cd</em>, and
this area were calculated as before; (2) carried from <em>c</em> around all
the area above <em>cd</em> and the area measured as in other cases; and (3)
these two results added and averaged.</p>

<p>To apply the method for <em>ab</em>, or constant error computation, to <em>cd</em>
should give equal readings at <em>c</em> or a 0 mean error, a result evidently
incorrect in the record selected.</p>

<p>After averaging results by the planimeter, the collection of data
has been arranged by months; the record for one month only can
be presented here, but the method of tabulation is the same throughout.</p>

<p>Each figure given for N, M, c and v, in the accompanying typical
table for the month of May, 1904 (pages 495-499), is the average

<p>It is necessary to observe that the limits of space imposed on the
writer preclude all but the barest outline of the deductions to be drawn
from the investigation, and to this fact is due whatever of dogmatism
is inherent in the argument; for it is manifestly impossible
to present all the material, and the writer asks, then, the indulgence
of the reader when he claims to have impartially examined and presented
the evidence.</p>

<p>The records are averaged for nine subjects, three of them being
left-handed. For the right hand we find, for mean error, a reduced
error with visual control.</p>

<p>For constant errors, a similar result is apparent; when following
the eyes-closed curve one may note a large negative error 20-50
beats, and a similar but larger positive error 70-160 beats, with a
falling to a negative error again at 200 beats.</p>

<p>This may be interpreted to mean a groping for the correct length
of line at the lower speeds when some time for reflective processes
is allowed, and an inhibitory effect on the motor discharge; later
the speed prevents this discrimination, and introspective testimony
goes to show that a mental conception of a barrier, beyond which
one cannot carry the pencil, is set up and kept more or less constant
through the help of the joint and muscular sensations. It would
follow, then, that this muscular stop is overestimated where reflection
is not possible.</p>

<p>Finally, the falling-off of the length of the line is probably due to
physical inability to rule a line of the full length of 140 mm. at 200
beats per minute and an examination of some individual cases confirms
this opinion, for the lines may be started some distance away
from the origin apparently in order to end them at the correct point.</p>

<p>Curve inclinations are upward, for mean errors, with visual control,
while the eyes-closed records show no increase in error for the
increased speeds.</p>

<p>For constant errors, with visual control, there is a similar inclination
downward for both hands, with a 0 error at about 120 beats.
It should be noted that this opposite tendency in mean and constant
errors suggests that they should be kept separate in all computation.</p>

<p>The left-handed subjects have much better control of their left
hand than have the right-handed subjects, and they may dispense
with visual control to a large extent.</p>

<p>On the other hand, for right-hand records we find much the same
increase in irregularity and error for both left- and right-handed subjects;
they all must depend on visual control for reduction of errors.</p>

<p>It follows that the non-visual control exerted by the left-handed
subjects on the right hand is as good or as great as for the right-handed
subjects; while they have the hand in which they may be
expected to excel under much better control.</p>

<p>It is not intended to present this as an argument for teaching left-handedness,
but it is certainly suggestive when considering the question
that ambidexterity be taught in early life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span></p>

<p>It should be noted that two of the three left-handed subjects might
be expected, because of special training, to show marked manual
dexterity, while only one of the four right-handed subjects has had
special training along this line.</p>

<p>No extended discussion is appropriate here as to the question of
what portion of this extra ability of the left-handed subjects to react
accurately is due to practice and habit, <em>i. e.</em>, is automatic, and accomplished
without reference to the sensory motor by-path to the
cerebral cortex; and on the other hand, as to whether the direct
sensory motor path via spinal cord or medulla is not cut off entirely.</p>

<p>For 140 mm. averages and free motion, we find in general</p>

<p>(1) a reduced error and greater uniformity of result at all speeds
where visual control is added, in the case of both mean and constant
errors and for all subjects;</p>

<p>(2) the mean errors for visual-control records show a rise along
a line whose equation is approximately <em>y</em> = <em>px</em>, or the equation of a
straight line, where <em>p</em> is an undetermined constant.</p>

<p>On the other hand,</p>

<p>(3) the eyes-closed mean errors show no increase or decrease in
value during the entire series;</p>

<p>(4) the constant errors for visual-control records show a drop
from positive errors to negative errors, along a line whose equation
is approximately <em>y</em> = <em>qx</em> or the equation of a straight line, where <em>q</em> is
an unknown constant, somewhat less in value than <em>p</em> in the case of
mean errors; the constant error becomes 0 at about 120 beats;</p>

<p>(5) the eyes-closed constant errors follow the same equation for
left-handed subjects, using the left hand, but all other cases suggest
a curve of the parabolic form, having 0 constant errors at 60 and 180
beats and being convex upward.</p>

<p>Considering individual records for 14 cm.</p>

<p>A general survey of the charts suggests certain irregularities that
call for explanation, for there will be sudden large increases in errors,
that are explicable on the hypothesis that the subject has temporarily
lost control of the moving hand, that is, that fatigue is to be noted.</p>

<p>While the purpose of the investigation has been to allow no lines
to be ruled while the subject was conscious of any such feeling, there
being a pause of any desired length to permit time for rest, it is to be
noted that a considerable amount of recorded data as to fatigue shows
that it is an unconscious or subconscious phenomena.</p>

<p>Further, the series of records have been arranged to occur from
20 to 200 beats and never in the reverse order, because of subjective<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>
limitations, so it is reasonable to expect that during the period of
twenty minutes to one half an hour required for a series of records,
there will be lapses of volitional control entirely beyond the ken of
the subjects. It is to this cause rather than to pure chance that the
results will be attributed. With this exception, the individual records
show close agreement with their average.</p>

<p>The results obtained from a consideration of free hand-movements
of 1, 10, and 14 cm. length are:</p>

<p>For 14 cm. lines</p>

<p>for the average of nine subjects:</p>

<p>The mean errors,</p>

<p>(1) increase with speed for eyes open;</p>

<p>(2) do not change in error with speed-change for eyes closed;</p>

<p>(3) visual control reduces errors for right hand, but does not for
the left;</p>

<p>(4) right-handed subjects alone gain from visual control.</p>

<p>The constant errors,</p>

<p>(1) decrease with speed in visual cases;</p>

<p>(2) increase with speed to the middle and then reduce to 200 beats
for eyes closed;</p>

<p>(3) left-handed subjects are more accurate for the left hand and
can dispense with visual control;</p>

<p>(4) all subjects need visual control for the right hand;</p>

<p>(5) left-handed subjects show less error throughout for non-visual.</p>

<p>For the individual cases,</p>

<p>the mean errors</p>

<p>(1) show evidences of loss of control or fatigue for some speeds,
and the average results are confirmed.</p>

<p>The constant errors show that the average deductions are confirmed.</p>

<p>Lines 10 cm. long:</p>

<p>Averages for seven subjects as regards mean errors have especial
interest for l.h.e.c. records, which alone show a rise of error with
speed-increase.</p>

<p>Noting that the records are overwhelmingly averages of right-handed
subjects (six to one), it is of interest to examine this record.</p>

<p>We may say, then, that for right-handed subjects, the voluntary
control for the right hand is not much improved by the introduction
of visual assistance; it is more marked for speeds of 100 beats or
less than for the high speeds. And in the latter case, it is under 10%;
but when the left hand is considered, a marked gain or 40 or 50%<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span>
is apparent, when the eyes are used except for the two lowest
speeds.</p>

<p>As far as it is possible to offer any hypothesis from the few facts
tabulated, it may be said that right-handedness implies a high development
of muscular control, but slightly improved by the introduction
of the visual element, as far as the right hand is concerned;
but for the left hand muscular control comparable to the right-hand
control can be obtained only with visual control; in short, I fail to
find evidences of cross-education, where the visual element is absent,
nearer than about 50% of the mean error.</p>

<p>No clearly marked gain through visual control can be pointed to
in the case of constant errors; there is, to be sure, a slight gain in
steadiness and error-reduction, where eyes help in the case of both
hands, but not 5% in magnitude of the difference noted with mean
errors.</p>

<p>Individual records show fatigue-points at 40 to 80 beats and again
above 140 beats, but there is no perceptible loss of control during
a series of lines ruled at only one speed.</p>

<p>It is apparent, when comparing with the 140 mm. records, that there
is no physiological reason why the subjects may not rule the full
length of a 10 cm. line at 200 beats, and the limit of movement for
high speeds is probably between 10 and 14 cm.</p>

<p>The constant errors are in general positive and only Me. shows a
tendency to underrule lines at high speeds.</p>

<p>For 10 cm. lines,</p>

<p>for the average record,</p>

<p>(1) the mean-error curve is horizontal for l.h.e.o., but otherwise
rises with speed-increase;</p>

<p>(2) visual control is a 10% gain for right hand and 40 to 50% for
the left, so right-handedness is prominent for the eyes-closed series;</p>

<p>(3) the constant-error curve for r.h.e.c. rises, but all others show
reduction of error as rate increases;</p>

<p>(4) visual-control gains are not over 5%.</p>

<p>The individual curves show,</p>

<p>for mean errors,</p>

<p>(1) marked-fatigue points for l.h.e.o;</p>

<p>(2) r.h.e.o. curve is horizontal, but all others rise;</p>

<p>(3) l.h.e.o. curve is about the same as r.h.e.o., but there is more
loss for non-visual series with left hand.</p>

<p>For constant errors,</p>

<p>(1) r.h.e.c. curve rises, but all others are horizontal;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span></p>

<p>(2) the eyes reduce errors especially for the left hand;</p>

<p>(3) overruling is prominent even at high speeds, for there is no
evidence that the lines are shortened at high speeds.</p>

<p>Lines 1 cm. long:</p>

<p>Averages are made for nine subjects, three being left-handed.</p>

<p>The eyes are effective in reducing mean errors and to a less extent
for constant errors.</p>

<p>A noteworthy feature of the constant-error record is that the errors
are positive with one exception, that of 20 beats with l.h.e.c. and
even this curve jumps rapidly above the 0 line.</p>

<p>In all cases the motor discharge is of sufficient magnitude to cause
overruling in cases of normal lines of one cm. The assistance afforded
by the eyes is not marked.</p>

<p>Certain evidence of an introspective character, that most of the
subjects offer, is to the effect that, "when I would do good, evil is
present with me"; that, where there is a decided feeling that the
muscular limit, if such a term be permitted, is exceeded, yet the
subject's will-power is not sufficient to inhibit the overruling; there
is a more or less vivid conscious error in the 10 mm. series for the
hands.</p>

<p>In regard to the relation of mean and constant errors, there is more
close uniformity than with the 140 mm. lines, but it is to be noted
that there is no comparison to be drawn between maximum or minimum
points; for example, at 100 beats the minimum points for
r.h.e.o. agree closely, but the maximum constant error matches the
minimum mean error at 100 beats for r.h.e.c.</p>

<p>We cannot predict, then, that a subject capable of closely ruling
to the normal will be able also to rule each line of the same length
as the rest of the series, or <em>vice versa</em>.</p>

<p>As in the case of mean errors in general note that subjects show
a less constant error and more regularity for their more dexterous
member; it is not true for the left hand that for left-handed subjects
visual control is a hindrance for accurate work; otherwise the same
gain, by use of the eyes, is to be noted for the rest of the records.</p>

<p>Individual records show close correspondence with the average
of results, and the latter may be considered fairly representative.</p>

<p>Almost the whole series shows the constant error positive, the most
consistent example being for J. with l.h.e.o.; this tendency to overrun
the 1 cm. lines is consistently uniform and has been elsewhere
commented on, so it may be left with the observation that the log
shows that the subjects were frequently conscious of this overruling,
but confessed inability to correct it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span></p>

<p>Only in the case of Y. for the three left-handed subjects and for W.
among the six right-handed men does the left hand show less mean
error than the right hand, and all other cases show such an interweaving
of curves as to render it difficult to perceive any advantage
that the more dexterous hand possesses on the score of accuracy.</p>

<p>For constant errors:</p>

<p>For individual cases it is to be noted that for the left-handed subjects
J. is better for the right hand, Le. is indifferent, and Y. prefers
the left hand; while three of the six right-handed subjects prefer
the left hand and one is indifferent; thus giving still further proof
that a more dexterous hand is a fiction on the score of the right or
left-handed theory, when accuracy of straight-line movement is to
be considered.</p>

<p>For 1 cm. lines,<br />
for the average, note<br />
for the mean errors:</p>

<p>(1) visual control reduces errors;</p>

<p>(2) errors increase for eyes open, but decrease for eyes closed, as
speed increases when considering right hand, but left-hand errors
are constant;</p>

<p>(3) as left-handed subjects are better for r.h.e.o. than right-handed
subjects, but not for eyes closed, it is suggested that visual control
equalizes differences in the subject's less trained hand.</p>

<p>For constant errors:</p>

<p>(1) visual control reduces errors;</p>

<p>(2) curves are horizontal in all cases;</p>

<p>(3) all errors are positive, showing consistent overruling;</p>

<p>(4) as visual control of the left hand is a gain for right-handed
but a hindrance for the left-handed subjects, the more practised
hand is probably able to dispense with visual control, and depend
largely on the muscular sense.</p>

<p>Mean and constant errors are not comparable. For the individual
cases we find a corroboration of the above and for mean errors: more
dexterous hand does not excel, and evidence against ambidexterity is
conflicting; for constant errors: overruling is consciously done.</p>

<p>Constrained hand-movements for lines 14 and 1 cm. long and for
the weight, both accelerating and retarding the movement, are to be
next considered.</p>

<p>Constrained motions are of two general types as examined by the
writer. Series of the records for the hands were taken at 140 mm.
and 10 mm. bases with a weight hung on the finger or fingers of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>
hand under investigation; in one series the weight acted as a pull
or accelerating effect on the ruled line and in the other series the
weight was imposed as a retarding effect, tending to restrain the
movement of the hand.</p>

<p>This weight was in all cases 260 grams, this weight being chosen
as of sufficient amount to have a perceptible effect, but not large
enough to cause feelings of pain or fatigue in any case.</p>

<p>The average for seven subjects, three being left-handed, is as
follows:</p>

<p>In general, the mean errors for the right hand are less, and less
variable as compared with the left hand. The left-hand records are
very close to the corresponding right-hand curves, especially the
portions of the eyes-closed records 20 to 120 beats.</p>

<p>This may be said for both mean and constant errors. In general,
mean errors are reduced, and curves are more nearly straight lines
when the weight is added; also the weight reduces constant errors,
and gains more regular records at all speeds. It is to be noted as a
point of unusual interest that there is no apparent shortening of the
line ruled when the weight is hung on the hand, for the negative
errors are less, not more when the weight is applied.</p>

<p>In general, then, the imposition of a weight that will be small enough
not to cause pain or fatigue shows that both mean and constant
errors are reduced; that the amount of error is less variable over
the range of speeds used; that the records show no retarding effect,
but that the subject is both able to move the hand just as far as without
the weight, and do it with much greater accuracy.</p>

<p>Individual records for 14 cm. and weight-retarding show a marked
reduction in both mean and constant errors, and a less marked gain
in uniformity in every case. This tends to confirm the introspective
opinion of W. subject that the imposition of a retarding weight tends
to reduce errors of both classes and to cause greater steadiness.</p>

<p>It should be added that there is evidence of an occasional letting-go
of voluntary control, so to speak, resulting in a large increase in
mean error, as already pointed out, or a large increase in negative
constant error, as shown on all individual records, and it would seem
then that the matter of cortical control is more vital and indispensable
for the restricted movements.</p>

<p>The effect of weight-retardation on visual records is to reduce the
error and steady the ruling of the less dexterous hand to a much more
marked degree than for the well-trained hand.</p>

<p>In the l.h.e.c. records the lack of corrective effect of visual control<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>
is marked, as in the case of free movements, but the dip in the curve
at 30 to 70 is not noted in the free ruling and should be considered
as a distinct shortening due to weight-retardation before discriminative
processes have oriented the subject.</p>

<p>Without considering the accelerating weight-records in detail note
that:</p>

<p>The effect of weights (less than that necessary to cause pain or
fatigue), either tending to accelerate or retard motions, is to reduce
both mean and constant errors and to render more uniform or more
uniformly increasing or decreasing such errors, except in the case
of l.h.e.c., where constant errors are greater positively with the weight-pulling
and greater negatively with the weight-retarding, than for
free motions; that is, the effect of the weight is natural, and shows
no signs of inhibition in this particular case.</p>

<p>There is no such marked fluctuation in error for the pull-records
as was noted for the weighted curves, and it is further noted that the
individual pull-records are more bunched or consolidated about some
mean than are the free-movement curves. This suggests that the
accelerating weight is a decided help for accuracy and regularity,
and it would seem to call for less voluntary control than for either
of the other movements.</p>

<p>Further, as the effect of pulling weights is to equalize the accuracy
of movement of the hands, the hypothesis is proposed that weights
either accelerating or retarding the movements of the hand tend to
equalize their accuracy or to promote ambidexterity as far as accuracy
of straight-line mean errors is concerned.</p>

<p>L.h.e.c. rise for Ha., are horizontal for J., W., and Y., and slope
downward for the other subjects, the net effect being a slight downward
slope. The loss of accuracy and regularity when the visual
sense is inhibited is to be noted in every case, it being especially
marked for Bo., Li., and W.</p>

<p>As compared with the r.h.e.c., there is not sufficient evidence to
lead to the conclusion that the right hand is a more accurate member
than the left, but on the contrary the left-hand record for non-visual
control is lower for both weighted series than is the right-hand
curve. Contrasting this with the eyes-open records for free and
weighted movements, the visually aided results show a greater accuracy
and regularity for the right hand.</p>

<p>This leads to a proposition that the greater dexterity on the line
of accuracy, of one hand, that is the right hand for right-handed subjects,
and the left hand for left-handed subjects, is a matter of visual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span>
control and is in no sense due to the muscular sense or to automatic
action, for without eyes we are ambidextrous as far as accuracy of
linear movements is concerned; the proposition needs careful scrutiny
in application to the general question, but is held to be correct
within the range of experiments.</p>

<p>We are tempted to extend this matter somewhat in the following
way, by saying that there is no evidence deducible from this research
that there is hereditary preponderance of activity or accuracy
of one hand or one leg (as shown later) over its mate, and the baby
is brought into the world with an equal capacity of accuracy of both
members.</p>

<p>It is, then, an evolutionary matter, not racial but individualistic,
and right-handedness or left-handedness is largely a development
after birth. Our system of education is responsible for the over-development
of one hand, and such a case as that of Dr. Anderson
of the Yale University Gymnasium, who in class demonstration
cannot instantly tell which hand is being used to actuate the chalk
at the blackboard, is the normal symmetrically developed man.</p>

<p>The school reform for ambidextrous training is radical enough,
but seems a logical conclusion of the argument. Apologies are appended
for driving the argument beyond the limits of the investigation,
but it is hoped that the enquiry is at least suggestive.</p>

<p>For 14 cm. lines,<br />
weight-retarding movements:</p>

<p>For the average of nine subjects:</p>

<p>The weight reduces errors and promotes regularity in the case of
both mean and constant errors, nor does it tend to cause underruling,
save in the case of left-handed subjects for l.h.e.c. records. There
is a gain, in general, when the visual factor is introduced.</p>

<p>For mean errors,</p>

<p>(1) right-hand curves are horizontal, while the visual records show
increasing error and l.h.e.c. a reduction of errors;</p>

<p>(2) the right hand gives slightly better results;</p>

<p>(3) note that l.h.e.c. record is equally good for free or weighted
movements.</p>

<p>For constant errors,</p>

<p>(1) r.h.e.o. and l.h.e.o. curve downward, while both non-visual
curves slope upward;</p>

<p>(2) the left hand seems equally efficient, as compared with the
right hand.</p>

<p>For individual cases,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span></p>

<p>note (1) fatigue-spots are more numerous than for free movements,
especially for the left hand;</p>

<p>(2) weight reduces both mean and constant errors and to a less
extent even records.</p>

<p>For mean errors,</p>

<p>(1) visual control reduces errors;</p>

<p>(2) the weight tends to equalize the accuracy of the right and left
hands.</p>

<p>For constant errors,</p>

<p>(1) there is no general testimony showing shortening of lines at
high speeds;</p>

<p>(2) the less trained hand is more helped by the weight, especially
for non-visual work.</p>

<p>The evidence for right- and left-handed subjects is inconclusive,
and we cannot finally say that the more trained hand is capable of
greater accuracy.</p>

<p>Weight-accelerating movements:</p>

<p>The average of seven subjects:</p>

<p>The accelerating weight reduces mean and constant errors, and
improves regularity of curves, except for l.h.e.c. constant-error record.
There is some evidence that a pull causes overruling, while a retarding
weight causes underruling, but there are exceptions enough to
warrant care in finally accepting this statement. Visual control with
accelerating weight reduces error more than the weight acting alone.</p>

<p>For mean errors,</p>

<p>(1) weight reduces errors for r.h.e.o. and l.h.e.c. as compared
with free-movement records, while the other two curves are inconclusive;</p>

<p>(2) visual sense helps in accurate ruling;</p>

<p>(3) non-visual records are not reduced, as a rule, from the results
of free motion.</p>

<p>For constant errors,</p>

<p>(1) the accelerating weight tends to greater accuracy, with an
exception for the-non-visual records.</p>

<p>No testimony of marked importance is to be noted in comparison
of right-handed and left-handed subjects; the more trained hand
shows greater accuracy in some cases, but fails to excel in others; so
the data is inconclusive.</p>

<p>For individual cases we find:</p>

<p>(1) the acceleration records are more accurate and regular, and
present fewer lapses than the free or retardation results, suggesting
greater ease with weight assisting;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span></p>

<p>(2) visual control is prominent throughout, and evidence shows
that this sense is the greatest factor in the predominance of the more
trained hand; the non-visual records should and do show no marked
difference in the hands;</p>

<p>(3) a weight tends to equalize accuracy of hands;</p>

<p>(4) the overruling effect of weight is over-corrected in some cases
for constant error of low rates.</p>

<p>Constrained movements of 1 cm.:</p>

<p>The average is of seven subjects, three of them being left-handed:</p>

<p>With weight-retarding movement, there is no reduction of mean
error with visual control of right hand, but there is with the left.
Constant errors show little reduction for either hand with eyes
open.</p>

<p>The facts would seem to warrant the hypothesis that, for the left
hand, a movement uncontrolled visually, whether restricted by a
weight or not, can be made with greater accuracy, when time is permitted
for discriminative and reflective processes and visual-control
results in about the same error whatever the speed, while the
right-hand motions show no such evening effect of visual control
with the weight-records or even reduction of error; the free movement,
however, does show a reduction of error.</p>

<p>A general statement may be deduced that, for lines of 10 mm. in
length, there is no difference in either mean or constant errors, when
a weight is imposed to cause retardation, provided the weight is not
large enough to cause pain or fatigue.</p>

<p>By separating the averages for right- and left-handed subjects, it
may be further said that:</p>

<p>Visual control is not efficient to reduce the error and no particular
gain in regularity can be noted. The left-handed subjects show, for
the left hand, much better results without visual control as far as the
free motion is concerned.</p>

<p>While somewhat contradictory, it may be stated that constant
errors are reduced by the weight addition, and there is some evidence
leading to the belief that the ruled line is shorter when the weight
acts as a retarding influence.</p>


<p class="p6">I<span class="smcapa">NDIVIDUAL</span> R<span class="smcapa">ECORDS</span></p>

<p>Considering lines 10 mm. long with a retarding weight:</p>

<p>A glance over the seven individual records shows some considerable
increase in both constant- and mean-error irregularities, as compared
with the free-motion curves, as well as in actual errors; there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span>
are distinct losses of volitional control for both classes of errors,
especially at or near the ends of the series.</p>

<p>There are cases of very low mean error to be found on all records,
where the value is 1/4 mm. or less, and, while the same phenomenon
is found with free motion, it is more marked here and occurs more
frequently; in most cases it seems as a drop from errors of larger
values rather than a gradual matter, as if the subject realized the
large error and exerted unusual volitional control to correct and
produce a very accurate record, but found that the attention needed
was beyond his will-power, as shown by the immediate lapse of
accuracy.</p>

<p>There is an indirect confirmation of this view from the introspective
testimony of the subjects.</p>

<p>The visual element steadies but does not reduce mean errors when
weight is retarding.</p>

<p>The general shape of curve for eyes closed is downward 20-40
beats, and rising for the rest of the series; it is less regular, but more
accurate than the visual results.</p>

<p>The fact that constant errors are mostly positive leads to a denial
of any inhibitory effect of the retarding weight.</p>

<p>For 1 cm. lines,</p>

<p>weight-retarding movements:</p>

<p>For the average of seven subjects we find:</p>

<p>(1) visual control does not improve accuracy or regularity as in
free movements;</p>

<p>(2) a retarding weight tends to make errors constant whatever
the speed-rate;</p>

<p>(3) the testimony goes to show that the free-movement records
are more accurate than the retardation ones.</p>

<p>Mean errors are:</p>

<p>(1) no more accurate and perhaps less regular, when the weight
is imposed;</p>

<p>(2) right- and left-handed subjects are equally accurate.</p>

<p>Constant errors:</p>

<p>(1) the more dexterous hand is superior for coÃ¶rdinations requiring
accuracy;</p>

<p>(2) ruled lines are slightly shortened in some cases;</p>

<p>(3) weight-records do not give more accurate results as compared
with free movements.</p>

<p>For individual records we find:</p>

<p>(1) retarding weights increase errors and irregularity;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span></p>

<p>(2) fatigue-points are more marked and frequent than for free
movements.</p>

<p>Mean errors,</p>

<p>(1) the visual factor is of some value, but the testimony is varied;
right hand for increased regularity only, and left hand for greater
accuracy only;</p>

<p>(2) curves are horizontal or reducing with speed-increase.</p>

<p>Constant errors,</p>

<p>(1) the more dexterous hand coÃ¶rdinates better;</p>

<p>(2) all errors are positive;</p>

<p>(3) visual control helps only for regularity;</p>

<p>(4) curves are horizontal or rising.</p>

<p>With weight-accelerating movements, the average record shows
a sudden rise in mean error at both ends, not in evidence with free
or retardation results.</p>

<p>In general it is to be noted:</p>

<p>(1) that the visual element is of no value for reducing the error,
and of little value for promoting regularity;</p>

<p>(2) that the pull-records are closely comparable to the free-motion
records, and the accelerating influence of the weight is imperceptible;</p>

<p>(3) that the pull-records are more regular and closer to the free-motion
curves than are the weighted records, especially at the ends
of the left-hand curves.</p>

<p>For constant errors:</p>

<p>It is more in accord with the facts to say that the imposition of
a weight tends to reduce the constant error, and this is more marked
when the weight acts in pulling or to accelerate the motion.</p>

<p>Comparing with the weighted curve, we find the same general type
of rising curve, similarly located, and the same is true when compared
with the free-motion curve. Constant errors are reduced, but
slightly, and visual control is rendered nil, when the weight acts
either to accelerate or retard the movement, and of the two, the accelerating
effect is more marked, as reducing errors and promoting
regularity.</p>

<p>There is no appreciable tendency for the weight to reduce the ruled
lines when retarding motion, nor is the weight as accelerating, able
to extend the line beyond the point set in the free motion.</p>

<p>When contrasting averages from right- and left-handed subjects
it may be said:</p>

<p>As compared with free motions there is a slight reduction of error<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span>
and irregularity more marked with the left-handed subjects, but a
general close correspondence of results.</p>

<p>The question is now appropriate, why should the right-handed
men show a reduced error for speed-increase, while the left-handed
subjects show the reverse? Bearing in mind that the right hand is
the more dexterous or better trained in the former case, it may be
suggested that the order of record from 20 toward 200 beats is such
as to cause more accurate results at the upper limit, in spite of the
fact that less time is allowed for discrimination and adjustments;
on the other hand, left-handed subjects have much less advantage
of practice and habit in their use of the right hand, and will show
the predominance of error, when the ruling is too rapid for careful
discrimination.</p>

<p>It becomes a struggle between automatism, or semi-automatism,
on the one hand, and discriminative processes on the other.</p>

<p>Visual control is not an advantage in the case of accelerating
weight, and the large reduction in error with visual control for the
free movements is not evident with weighted motions.</p>

<p>For the left-handed subjects we find that the eyes-closed record
shows closer work than does the eyes-open curve; it is lower and
nearer the line of 0 error; in this respect, it shows the same effect
as with the free-motion curve, and to a less extent as for the retardation
weight-record. The accelerating record is, however, more accurate
and regular than either of the other curves.</p>

<p>It will be clear, then, as observed, that for constant errors, visual
control tends to reduce errors and steady records whatever the speed-increase,
as far as right-handed subjects are concerned, but this effect
is not noted for left-handed subjects using the right hand, and, with
their left hand, visual control is a disturbing element.</p>

<p>Further this erratic effect of visual control is less marked but clear
when the weight acts as a retarding factor, but is much more noticeable
for the free-motion record.</p>

<p>Individual records show few lapses of control for either errors.</p>

<p>The bulk of the evidence is that the weight imposition, whether
acting as a retarding or accelerating influence, is effective in rendering
the results more accurate and regular, though at least one subject
exhibits the opposite effect for the accelerating weight.</p>

<p>The left hand is better for J., Le., and W., but is less regular for
all subjects, save Le. and W., showing again a somewhat complex
mass of testimony, from which we may conclude that the right hand
is the more accurate member for right-handed subjects, and to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span>
much less extent the left hand is preferred by the left-handed subjects.</p>

<p>Visual control is to be noted as effective for accuracy and regularity,
except for Ha., where the curves closely intertwine, and for
J., where the eyes-closed record is much better.</p>

<p>Weight-accelerating movements:</p>

<p>For the average of seven subjects we find</p>

<p>visual control is of doubtful advantage, for left-handed subjects,
but shows a clearly marked reduction of error for right-handed subjects.</p>

<p>Mean errors are:</p>

<p>(1) similar in all respects to free-movement results;</p>

<p>(2) acceleration-curves are closer to free-movement results than
are retardation records;</p>

<p>(3) the more trained hand shows reducing error for speed-increase,
while the other hand shows increasing errors, because of superiority
of practice-effects over the native tendency to increase error as speed-rate
rises, for the more dexterous hand alone.</p>

<p>Constant errors:</p>

<p>(1) there is no tendency to overrule, as compared with free movements,
when weight acts to accelerate movements, for there are
even cases of lines being shortened with accelerating weights;</p>

<p>(2) a weight seems to negate the results of visual control, as a
rule.</p>

<p>For individual records we find:</p>

<p>(1) fatigue-points, for the right hand only, are to be found in a few
cases;</p>

<p>(2) weight promotes regularity and accuracy;</p>

<p>(3) visual control is effective only for reducing variations of error;</p>

<p>(4) the better trained hand is the more accurate in the records, to
a slight extent;</p>

<p>(5) there are evidences of semi-hypnotic or dreamy states in the
non-visual series.</p>

<p>Series of records were taken at 100 mm. and 10 mm. bases for the
hands, with what is called compound motion. This consisted in an
additional movement of the hand that was not ruling with the pencil,
in a similar manner, as regards the amplitude and general character
of the motion, but in an opposite direction.</p>

<p>For example, suppose the left hand is ruling a 100 mm. line outward,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span>
or to the left; coincident with this movement would be a
similar motion of the right hand outward or to the right. The origin
of both motions, or the starting-ends of actual and imaginary ruled
lines, was optional, it being desired to bring out the effect of such
additional motion, as little complicated as possible with restrictions,
as to its position or extent. Actually this distance varied from about
10 mm. where both motions were outward to 600 mm. for inward
motions.</p>

<p>A comparison of such compound motions with single-hand records
shows in general the following:</p>

<p>For 10 cm. lines:</p>

<p>The case for mean errors may be summed up by saying:</p>

<p>(1) left-hand records are less accurate and regular than the right-hand
curves;</p>

<p>(2) visual control reduces error and irregularity in all cases, but
is more marked with the left hand;</p>

<p>(3) errors increase with speed-increase;</p>

<p>(4) compound-motion records show little increase in error or irregularity,
as compared with the simple motions.</p>

<p>For constant errors:</p>

<p>No marked peculiarities are to be noted, but in general,</p>

<p>(1) left-hand records are less accurate and regular;</p>

<p>(2) visual control reduces errors and irregularity;</p>

<p>(3) errors reduce with increase of speed, except for compound
motion uncontrolled visually;</p>

<p>(4) compound-motion errors are not much greater, nor is the
irregularity increased.</p>


<p class="p6">I<span class="smcapa">NDIVIDUAL</span> C<span class="smcapa">ASES</span></p>

<p>100 mm. hand with compound motions.</p>

<p>A glance at the charts shows for individual records a few examples
of inhibition of voluntary control for both constant and mean
errors, it being much more marked in the case of mean errors.</p>

<p>These lapses of control appear for constant errors for A. with
l.h.e.c. at 160 and 180 beats, for mean errors for G. with l.h.e.c. at
200 and with r.h.e.c. at 180 beats; for Le. with l.h.e.c. at 50 and with
r.h.e.c. at 160 beats; for A. with l.h.e.c. at 200 beats; thus giving
evidence that the visual element has a steadying effect, and that the
left hand is less reliable save for Le.</p>

<p>There seems reason for contending that the compound motion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span>
can be carried out, as arranged, without loss of accuracy or regularity
on the part of the ruling hand, and further that the subjects are
pretty generally apt to react to a given stimulus within certain rather
narrow limits of accuracy.</p>

<p>The evidence is here pretty conclusive that the right-handed subjects,
as a whole, show greater accuracy by about 25% for the more
dexterous hand; but it will be wise to consider the individual cases
on this point.</p>

<p>Greater regularity and accuracy for the right hand is attained by
all right-handed subjects, while the preference of Le. for the left
hand is clear but much less definite.</p>

<p>For individual cases:</p>

<p>The evidence again is fairly well marked that the more practised
hand will give a better account of itself even when visual control is
not called on.</p>

<p>The results for compound movements of the hand for 1 and 10
cm. lines are summarized as follows:</p>

<p>It should be kept in mind that the compound records were in all
cases taken in connection with a duplicate series of lines for one hand,
and called simple movements. These simple movements correspond
with the free-movement records that have been considered already.</p>

<p>The purpose has been to bring out the modification of results that
a compound movement introduces, rather than to bear heavily on
intrinsic phenomena, <em>i. e.</em>, comparison is deemed more important.</p>

<p>For lines 10 cm. long:</p>

<p>Average of seven subjects:</p>

<p>We find for mean and constant errors:</p>

<p>(1) left-hand records are less accurate and uniform;</p>

<p>(2) visual control increases accuracy and regularity, especially for
the left hand;</p>

<p>(3) there is an increase as the speed increases for mean errors,
and a decrease for constant errors;</p>

<p>(4) compound movements are practically as accurate and regular
as the simple ones for constant errors.</p>

<p>For individual cases:</p>

<p>(1) a few lapses of control or fatigue-spots more marked for mean
errors with the l.h.e.c., for the visual sense steadies ruling, and the
left hand is less reliable;</p>

<p>(2) compound and simple records show close agreement;</p>

<p>(3) the more trained hand reacts more accurately, and with greater
regularity;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</a></span></p>

<p>(4) non-visual records show a cautionary shortening of line at low
speeds, and another at the upper limit, the latter being due to physiological
limitations.</p>

<p>For 1 cm. lines:</p>

<p>As far as averages are considered:</p>

<p>We may say, then, for mean errors:</p>

<p>(1) that visual control is effective for reducing errors, and increasing
steadiness in both sets of records, being more marked with the
less trained hand, the left;</p>

<p>(2) only in the case of the l.h.e.c. curves is the movement of the
free hand noted as appreciably affecting the accuracy or steadiness
of the record.</p>

<p>(3) eyes-closed records in general show a considerably greater
error at 20 beats that practice rapidly reduces up to 40 to 60 beats.</p>

<p>We may note for constant errors:</p>

<p>(1) all errors are positive and confirm the earlier deductions on
this point;</p>

<p>(2) visual control reduces error and improves steadiness of record;</p>

<p>(3) the free hand-movement does not affect either the accuracy
or uniformity of results;</p>

<p>(4) errors do not increase with speed.</p>

<p>For individual records:</p>

<p>Comparing the individual cases of simple and compound movement,
there is no particular reason for concluding that the compound
movement is a disturbing influence as far as the records of all subjects
are concerned, save possibly the lapse of G. at 20 beats, and on the
other hand a case of greater accuracy and evenness for compound
movements for Mo. with r.h.e.c. constant error.</p>

<p>It is, then, possible to extend the conclusion of the 10 cm. records,
and say that both lengths of lines are ruled with a fairly constant
limit of error, whether the movement be simple or complicated by
movement of the free hand.</p>

<p>Individually there is testimony in favor of the gain in accuracy
with visual control for Hu., Hy., and Le., while the crossing of curves
for the other subjects shows that there is no difference in eyes-open
and eyes-closed results, the general conclusion being in favor of the
value of the eyes for accurate results.</p>

<p>For mean errors the right hand is more efficient in the case of A.,
Hu., Hy., and Me., while the reverse is the case for the rest, and the
evidence goes to suggest that greater accuracy can be attained with
the more practised hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span></p>

<p>For constant errors the right hand is more accurate in the case
of A., G., Hy., only; Me. and Mo. are equally accurate with the
hands, and the rest show a marked preference for the left hand, the
evidence being thus conflicting, pointing to the theory of ambidextrous
development on the lines of accuracy.</p>

<p>L.h.e.c. records are horizontal for all subjects except Hu., Me.,
and Mo., who show an upward slope to the curve. Evidences of
visual control as giving greater accuracy are noted in general above
70 beats and individually for Hy. and Mo., only, the remaining
records being so intertwined that no difference can be noted, all suggesting
that the eyes are of but little assistance when the left hand
is considered. The right hand is preferred with eyes closed by A.,
Hu., and Le., while four right-handed subjects testify that the less
trained hand is more accurate.</p>

<p>The testimony here seems conclusive as pointing to a denial of
the current notion as to the greater accuracy of the right hand for
right-handed subjects, and of the left hand for left-handed subjects,
and further suggests that visual control is a large factor in the supposed
superior excellence of the hand mentioned.</p>


<p class="p6">S<span class="smcapa">UMMARIZING</span></p>

<p>For lines 1 cm. long:</p>

<p>Average of seven subjects:</p>

<p>It may be said that:</p>

<p>(1) visual control reduces both mean and constant errors, especially
for left hand;</p>

<p>(2) errors are constant whatever the speed;</p>

<p>(3) constant errors are positive showing overruling in all cases;</p>

<p>(4) there is no disturbance created by the second-hand movement,
save for r.h.e.c. mean errors, where the accuracy is less for the compound
records; this is probably due to the fact that this record shows
the least evidence of voluntary control, and is thus most subject to
disturbances;</p>

<p>(5) there is a marked reduction of mean error 20-50 beats, probably
due to practice.</p>

<p>For individual cases note:</p>

<p>(1) fatigue-spots for non-visual mean errors only;</p>

<p>(2) the equality of result of both types of movements is noted for
all cases;</p>

<p>(3) the non-visual right-hand records for some subjects are more
accurate;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span></p>

<p>(4) the more trained hand is not, as a rule and subject to exceptions,
the more accurate one, especially for the non-visual records;
and</p>

<p>(5) there is evidence that the superior accuracy of the right hand
for right-handed subjects is largely a matter of visual control.</p>


<p class="p6">H<span class="smcapa">EAD</span>-R<span class="smcapa">ECORDS</span></p>

<p>There was no attempt made to differentiate the visual element
because the very movements of the head prevent the full use of the
eyes; as a matter of fact, the subject's attempt to make use of the
eyes and the aid is more marked at slow speeds and upon facing the
apparatus. It is to be noted here that the visual element, as reducing
the error at low speeds, is equally marked whether the eyes are directed
toward the recording pencil or not. This raises an interesting
question as to the direction the eyes must take for the optimal result;
must the eyes be fixed on the moving pencil, on its immediate surroundings,
or may they wander at will about the surrounding objects?</p>

<p>My own introspective testimony, corroborated by others, who
have acted as subjects for this investigation, is that the eyes are most
effective when gathering spatial relations in a gross way, and it may
be expected that the effects of visual control as reducing errors will
be equally efficient, whether the recording pencil be screened or
visible, provided it be possible to bring on the retina objects that
are grouped about the centre of attraction, the pencil, but not in its
immediate neighborhood.</p>

<p>The records show that there is underruling at the higher speeds
because of physiological limitations; but this shortening is greater
for the backward movements, for the position of the subject is such
as to lead to greater uncertainty as to the exact length of ruled line,
and it is probable that a cautionary or inhibitory feeling is the cause
of this shortening beyond what will be clearly due to inability to
perform the desired movement.</p>

<p>Further, visual control is effective, in the case of constant errors,
in lengthening the ruled lines at high speeds, and thus reducing the
negative constant error.</p>

<p>While the muscular control of the head is a constant, whether
the movement be forward or backward, it is less effective for constant
error reduction when the head is moved backward. Consequently,
while the backward and forward curves are fairly well in
correspondence, there is some reason for offering the proposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</a></span>
that either the eyes are of assistance in forward movements to reduce
mean errors at high speeds, and they are of no such value for
backward movements, or the muscular control of the platysma
myoides, trapezius and associated muscles of the neck group is more
nearly perfect for movements of the head forward than for backward
motions, the latter being to my mind the better hypothesis.</p>

<p>The results for head-movements for lines 1 and 10 cm. long are
summarized:</p>

<p>For lines of 10 cm. length:</p>

<p>Average of six subjects:</p>

<p>For mean errors:</p>

<p>(1) the curve for head-forward and head-backward closely corresponds
to l.h.e.c. record; the errors increase by 50% with increase
of speed-rate, suggesting that</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) visual control is negligible, as far as seeing the moving pencil
is concerned;</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) control of head for forward equals that for backward movements.</p>

<p>For constant errors:</p>

<p>(1) there is underruling at high speeds because of the usual physiological
limitations, and this is more marked for head backward
results, suggesting that</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) spatial relations are obtained, when the apparatus is visible,
that tend to correct underruling, or</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) an extra inhibitory effect, due to lack of knowledge of spatial
relations, is added to the normal physical shortening and the subject
moves the head a less distance than is naturally possible; or</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) the muscular control is less complete for movements of the head
backward.</p>

<p>For individual cases we find:</p>

<p>(1) fatigue-lapses are less in magnitude than for the hands, because
the head-movement can be only a fraction of the forearm-movement;</p>

<p>(2) mean errors increase and constant errors decrease with speed-rise;</p>

<p>(3) similarity of individual head-forward and head-backward
curves is suggestive, taken with the fact that no typical form of curve
is to be found;</p>

<p>(4) head-backward constant errors are greater and less regular
in all cases, suggesting that the eyes, in head-forward records, by getting
spatial relations, are more efficient.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span></p>

<p>For lines 1 cm. long:</p>

<p>Average of six subjects:</p>

<p>For mean errors note:</p>

<p>(1) the head-backward records are less regular than the head-forward
ones, and rise a little with speed-increase, showing visual
assistance for accuracy or better muscular control for the forward
movements or both;</p>

<p>(2) the constant errors show shortening of ruled lines at high speeds
a little more marked for the head-forward results;</p>

<p>(3) there is constant overruling.</p>

<p>Individual cases suggest:</p>

<p>(1) fatigue-spots are apparent, especially for head-backward movements;</p>

<p>(2) errors do not increase with speed;</p>

<p>(3) the movements of the head forward are under better control.</p>


<p class="p6">F<span class="smcapa">OOT</span>-R<span class="smcapa">ECORDS</span></p>

<p>10 cm. records show that</p>

<p>(1) the eyes are of no assistance as to increasing accuracy but help
in promoting regularity of error;</p>

<p>(2) a shortening of ruled lines with speed-increase is noticeable,
and is probably due to the usual physiological reason;</p>

<p>(3) the feet are capable of less accurate motion than the hands,
but show better results than the head;</p>

<p>(4) mean errors increase but constant errors decrease with speed-increase.</p>

<p>Individual records show:</p>

<p>(1) less violent fluctuations of errors in all respects than do the
results of head or hands, for vertical foot-movements are of less
extreme extent than are arm- or head-motions;</p>

<p>(2) that for visual control with mean errors, no foot is the more
accurate, and there is no reason to believe that the feet are unequally
educated.</p>

<p>1 cm. records show, as far as mean errors are concerned, that:</p>

<p>(1) visual control is of no value as either reducing actual errors
or as effecting greater regularity;</p>

<p>(2) Errors for foot-movements are no less, but considerably more
regular than for head-motions;</p>

<p>(3) errors for hand-movements are more regular, and only 50%
of the results for either head- or foot-movements;</p>

<p>(4) all curves are horizontal;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</a></span></p>

<p>(5) there is no appreciable advantage as to accuracy or regularity
that can be attributed to either foot. The evidence goes to show
that the subjects are ambipedalous, if it be permitted to coin such
a word.</p>

<p>In general, we find that, as far as constant errors are concerned,</p>

<p>(1) visual control does not help to reduce actual errors or promote
uniformity;</p>

<p>(2) errors for foot-movements are less than the head records, and
but little greater than the hand results, while the regularity for
the feet is comparable to the hand, and much greater than for the
head;</p>

<p>(3) all curves are horizontal;</p>

<p>(4) there is no particular advantage that either foot has over the
other either as to accuracy or regularity.</p>

<p>The evidence is that the subjects were ambipedalous, as far as
ability to reach a certain point equally well by either foot is concerned.
The popular notion has been to the contrary, and it is a point of
considerable importance to note the last point.</p>

<p>For example, in kicking, as developed by football trainers, it is
commonly assumed that the right foot for right-handed subjects
should be developed, and the opposite foot for left-handed men.
Or again, in the case of a person lost in the woods and walking in
a circle, it is observed that right-handed persons will turn to the left;
probably because of the pace of the right foot being slightly longer
than the left. My reply to this evidence will be that the data herein
presented is for vertical movements of the foot, starting from the
floor in every case, the subject being seated in a chair.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is an entirely different movement, calling
for a much different and greater muscular control in the case of kicking
or walking that must be considered. For this reason the evidence,
while conclusive within its range, is not offered as more than suggesting
that the feet are equally well trained for the usual adjustments,
and only an exhaustive investigation covering all possible
foot-movements will settle the question.</p>

<p>The result for foot-movements for lines 1 and 10 cm. long is here
summarized.</p>

<p>For lines 10 cm. in length:</p>

<p>Average of seven subjects:</p>

<p>Note in general that</p>

<p>(1) l.f.e.c. mean error is most erratic, while the same curve is the
most accurate, as far as constant errors are concerned;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</a></span></p>

<p>(2) the left foot mean and constant errors are slightly greater than
those for the right foot, for visual records;</p>

<p>(3) mean errors increase and constant errors reduce with speed-increase;</p>

<p>(4) the visual sense improves regularity, but does not reduce
errors;</p>

<p>(5) there is a physiological reason for the shortening of lines at
high speeds;</p>

<p>(6) the feet are more under control than the head, but less than
the hands.</p>

<p>For individual records:</p>

<p>(1) fatigue-lapses, all for non-visual, are less numerous and of less
magnitude than for the hands and head, for the vertical movement
of foot is likely to be of less extent than that of head and hands for
the particular motion required here;</p>

<p>(2) there is no foot capable of being called more accurate than
its mate;</p>

<p>(3) the eyes appear to be of no value for reducing or regulating
errors for foot-movements.</p>

<p>For lines 1 cm. long:</p>

<p>Average of six subjects:</p>

<p>It may be said in general that</p>

<p>(1) the visual sense is valueless for promoting accuracy or regularity
of curve;</p>

<p>(2) errors of foot-movements are more regular and, for the constant
errors, more accurate than for the head-records;</p>

<p>(3) errors of foot-movements are less and less regular by 50% as
compared with records for the hands;</p>

<p>(4) errors do not increase or decrease with speed-changes;</p>

<p>(5) the feet are equally accurate.</p>

<p>For individual results:</p>

<p>(1) fatigue-lapses and cases of large error-increases are noted in
a number of subjects, both for visual and non-visual records;</p>

<p>(2) further, evidence is available as to the indifference to visual
control;</p>

<p>(3) no preference for either foot is to be discovered.</p>

<p>The results for individual choice of rhythm.</p>

<p>In this series of records, the metronome was dispensed with, and
the subject was permitted to react as he desired, taking the speed
preferred because of ease, pleasure, or other reason.</p>

<p>Records were obtained for six subjects for feet, head, and hands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</a></span>
both single-hand and double-hand movements, all for lengths of
line 1 and 10 cm. The charts for individual choice were plotted for
a comparison of speeds rather than for accuracy.</p>

<p>It was noted for the hands:</p>

<p>(1) that every subject reacts more rapidly with the left hand;</p>

<p>(2) the eyes had little effect as to changing the speed-rate;</p>

<p>(3) single and double hand-movements were equally rapid.</p>

<p>Some subjects, as A., react more rapidly for the shorter lines, though
no clearly marked evidence of this speed-increase is to be noted.</p>

<p>For the head, the results for both eyes opened and closed show
the impossibility of separating the optimal or preferred rate of speed
on the score of visual assistance or because of direction of head-movement.</p>

<p>There is a close agreement of the subject as to his best speed, and
this is independent of special conditions; for example,</p>

<p>A. selects 50-57 beats per minute for 1 cm. and 48-68 for 10 cm.;
G. has a preference for 61-66 and 56-71; Hu. rises to 103-125 for
10 cm. and selects 68-82 for 1 cm.; Le. 52-55 for 1 cm. and 45-52
for 10 cm., and so on.</p>

<p>We may say, then, that free rate-choice for head-movements results
in a selection of some rate of speed that is not affected by the visual
sense or direction of movement, and is strictly individualistic, covering
a range of 50-130 beats per minute, and not increasing as the
amplitude of movement is reduced.</p>

<p>Turning to individual choice of speed-rate, for the feet it will be
seen that</p>

<p>(1) the non-visual records closely correspond as to chosen speed,
and there is a less close correspondence of visual speeds;</p>

<p>(2) the visual records are ruled at a lower rate in some cases, but
A., G., and Mo. show little difference;</p>

<p>(3) there is a tendency to speed up as the series progresses;</p>

<p>(4) the shorter lines are ruled with greater speed as a rule, though
G. and Le. fail to show this phenomenon;</p>

<p>(5) The left-foot records show a higher speed-rate for all cases.</p>

<p>Among many interesting points that cannot be examined in this
connection, such as relation of voluntary choice of rate to the main
line of metronome records as regards accuracy, the fact of the higher
rate of ruling for the left hand and foot stands most prominent.</p>

<p>Whether a record of head-movements to right or left, or other devices
to compare the sides of the body or to contrast arm and leg
speeds, will bear out this testimony is as yet unknown, so that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span>
writer prefers to announce the result and not now fit theory to data.
It may be said that the records were taken in reverse order and
rearranged, as regards right and left foot or hand, and, in addition,
the initial foot-movement varied with the subject, some being right
and some left.</p>

<p>We ask finally: Is the time in which the greatest exactitude is
produced, the same for every group of muscles; that is, has every
motor apparatus the same natural rhythm? and: Is this natural
rhythm a constant rapidity for all motor nerve-centres or does it
depend upon the complexity and character of the movement?</p>

<p>The comparison will fall first on the averages and finally on the
individual records.</p>

<p>The hand-movements show the following results:</p>

<p>Constant errors for 14 cm.:</p>

<p>For simple and weight accelerating and retarding motions, there
is a close agreement about 120 beats for the minimum error for visual
and right-hand non-visual records; left-hand non-visual records are
spread more, but will also average the same.</p>

<p>For 10 cm. simple and compound movements the visual minimum
errors are at 180-200 beats, while with the eyes closed the results
are grouped about 60 beats; one record, that for l.h.e.c., has
two minimum points at 60 and 180 beats, the latter being clearly
a crossing of the 0 error-line, because of physiological limitations.</p>

<p>For 1 cm. simple and weighted minimum errors are grouped between
20 and 60 beats, while the simple and compound group show
less regularity and a tendency to group minimum errors at 100 beats.</p>

<p>The head-movements show for both 1 and 10 cm. lines a minimum
error at 180-200 beats, there being, however, one exception at
100 beats for 10 cm. head-backward movements.</p>

<p>The foot-movements show minimum errors at 80 beats for the right
foot, and 180 and 100 beats for the left foot, visual and non-visual
respectively.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind for a moment the individual choice records, there
seems here a suggestion that the left foot is capable not merely of
higher speeds, but of minimum errors at the higher rates as compared
with the right foot.</p>

<p>No such differentiation of the hands can be discovered, however.</p>

<p>Mean errors:</p>

<p>For the hands:</p>

<p>For 14 cm. for simple and weighted results we find that the right-hand
and left-hand eyes-open minimum errors are at 180 beats, but
the non-visual left-hand minimums are at 30 beats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span></p>

<p>For 10 cm. simple and compound records we find all minimum
errors are between 160 and 200 beats.</p>

<p>For 1 cm. simple and weighted results there is a scattering of
minimum errors from 20 to 200 beats, with a heavy preponderance
at 200, and the same is true for the simple-compound series.</p>

<p>The head-movements minimum errors are at 40 beats without
exception.</p>

<p>The foot minimum errors are distributed from 20-30 beats for
the left foot to 160-180 for the right.</p>

<p>It is thus evident that each group of muscles and each motor centre
has its own optimum, and that the conditions of complexity, resistance,
etc., influence greatly the accuracy of the periodic movement
impulse.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_MOTOR_POWER_OF_COMPLEXITY" id="THE_MOTOR_POWER_OF_COMPLEXITY"></a>THE MOTOR POWER OF COMPLEXITY</h2>

<p>If every sensory stimulus has a motor reaction, then a simple figure
perceived in any way ought to produce a somewhat different response
from a more complex figure similarly perceived. Of course if only one
figure of each kind is given it is difficult to measure in any way this
difference, since it is so small. But we might make it measurable by
multiplying the process. Therefore I have cut out a row of similar
figures in a strip of cardboard and on another strip another series of
a different pattern. Now if these rows are counted figure by figure each
figure has a certain motor effect which influences the speed of counting,
so that the time of counting (measured by the chronoscope) should
give some indication of the comparative motor power of the figures in
question.</p>

<p>In the accompanying illustration nine cards of various patterns are
shown. Cards 1, 2, and 3 are comparatively simple patterns while
4, 5, and 6 are comparatively complex, Card 6 having the added
complication of different kinds of figures on the same card. Cards 7,
8, and 9 form another group, Card 7 having the same letter throughout,
Card 8 having letters composing a sentence and Card 9 a series
of the letters, mostly consonants, mixed promiscuously. In order to
prevent the subject from knowing the exact number, and thus, perhaps,
bring in another influence at the end of the row, most of the
different cards have different numbers of figures, but this difference is
not great and some cards have the same number. The subject usually
forgets, from one experiment to the next, the number on each card.</p>

<p>At first the experiment was performed with the figures in a straight
row, instead of in the broken line which is seen in the illustration.
In counting the straight rows, the observers found it hard to keep the
place in the line. A subject would become confused and count some
spot twice or else he would omit it altogether. Furthermore this disturbance
was found to be much greater with some figures than with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</a></span>
others, with Card 1, for example, more than with Card 2. Therefore
the device was adopted of diversifying the line, both by placing some
of the figures above and some below the line and by making the distances
from one figure to the next, different in the different cases. And
in order to prevent the subject from associating any peculiar turn in
the line with a certain number counted, it was decided to have the
arrangement on the different cards different. But it was still necessary
to have the intervals between figures about the same in all the cards,
and therefore the row was divided into sections of six figures each and
these sections were used as units, variously arranged, in constructing
the other rows. For example the first unit of Card 3 is the same as the
second of Card 4. Sometimes this six-figure unit is turned end for end
or upside down, and thus, though the same spaces are used, the cards
appear dissimilar.</p>

</div>

<p>The subject would be seated at the table with one hand resting
lightly on the key which sets the chronoscope in motion, his eyes
raised so that the table in front of him is not seen. One of the cards
would then be put in the proper position in front of him (always the
same), and he is told that all is ready. He looks down at the card and
as soon as he begins to count the first figures in the line he presses the
chronoscope key, and when he has reached the end of the line he releases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</a></span>
the key. The time for the operation is then noted. The whole
series of cards is thus gone through. An extra card of which no record
is taken is used for the first few tests so that the subject may be in the
proper state when the first test to be noted down is taken. Also the
order of the series is changed from one experiment to the next, each
card taking its turn at being first and last. It was hoped in this way
to distribute among the different cards the effects of practice and
fatigue, and also to guard against any expectations on the part of the
subject as to the character of the next card.</p>

<p>The subject is told to count as fast as he can, with a reasonable
feeling of certainty as to his correctness, the main object being to have
a uniform principle, in counting the different series. Wrong counts
were excluded, but later on the same cards given again so as to keep
the tables even. Subjects were not allowed to count the figures by
groups, but one by one. At first a certain amount of difficulty was
found in the fact that subjects in counting would repeat the numbers
to themselves, and as they seemed to be retarded by this, especially in
those numbers whose corresponding names have 2 or 3 syllables, the
result was that we were getting the speed with which subjects could
count the numbers from 1 up to 38 or 39 and this would be practically
the same whatever the figure. But all the subjects were finally trained
merely to think the number, or at least to have as little vocal adjustment
as possible. When this was done the subject no longer felt that it
was the speed with which he could count that was being measured but
the rate at which he could take in the different figures on the card, one
at a time.</p>

<p>Between three and four hundred tests were made of the counting of
the figures on the nine cards, the work being divided among seven
subjects, though not in exactly equal amounts. Since the number of
figures on the different cards are different, I have found the time it
takes to count one figure by dividing the total time by the number of
figures on a card. The following table shows the average time taken
by each subject for one figure on each card, time given in thousandths
of seconds. <em>A.M.V.</em> stands for average mean variation.</p>

<p>A, B, C, D, E, F, G are the different subjects, and 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.,
refer to the cards with the different patterns. It is seen at a glance that
great differences exist between the rates with which the different subjects
count. Subject G had much fewer tests than the others, and
thus, not having as much training, his average is higher in comparison
than it would be had he had the same training.</p>

<p>Now if we compare the counting of the first three or relatively simple
patterns with that of the next three or comparatively complex ones, we
notice at once that the simple figures are almost invariably counted
in less time than the complex, there being only two exceptions. B
counts 6 a little faster than 1, and G counts 6 faster than 1 and 3. Even
these apparent exceptions are easily explained. As noted already,
subjects are much more apt to lose their place in counting certain
cards than others. This is especially true of Card 1 even after the line
is broken. Now Card 6 is arranged on a different plan from the others,
for it has many kinds of figures on it. This is a great help in keeping
one's proper place in the counting of the series, and since wavering
between two figures is avoided, the series is counted more rapidly.
But B is the most rapid in counting, of all the subjects, and it is natural
that any differences in the ease of keeping place should show themselves
here, since the more rapid the counting the easier it is to lose
the proper position. This cannot be said of G, who is a slow counter,
but on the other hand it may be noted that he had only a few cases,
and at first the ability to keep one's position is much less than after
considerable experience. So in Cards 6 and 1 there are two conflicting
principles, degree of complexity and tendency toward confusion of
position. Of course both these principles are present in all the other
cards, but they reach a maximum in 1 and 6, in 1 extreme simplicity
with difficulty in keeping place, in 6 extreme complexity with ease
in keeping place. Card 1, it will be seen, is with nearly all subjects
a little slower than 2 and 3, while 6 is generally faster than 4 and 5.</p>

<p>Therefore it would seem that the apparently small exceptions are
not real exceptions, but variations due to the presence of other factors
than mere differences in complexity of the figures used. In observing
the averages for 7, 8, and 9 we see that as a rule 7 is fastest, 8 next, and
9 the slowest. The tables are not quite so regular as for the cards just
given. B and G count 8 faster than 7, and E counts 9 faster than 7.
The most of these cards have on them 36, 37, 38, or 39 figures. Card
8 has 43 letters. The subjects report that the last three on this card are
counted much faster. They know, as soon as they reach 40, just how
many there are, and it is hard to keep from counting the rest in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[Pg 531]</a></span>
group. Otherwise they do not feel any difference in counting Cards
8 and 9. Arranging the letters in words does not affect the speed of
counting, so far as they can see, for in counting they do not notice the
words at all.</p>

<p>When we average the records of all the subjects giving equal weight
to each subject, though the number of tests may be different with the
different men, we get the following table. Time given in thousandths
of seconds.</p>

<p class="center lefta">(1)  261.38<br />
(2)  253.49<br />
(3)  254.54<br />
(4)  267.46<br />
(5)  273.08<br />
(6)  267.22<br />
(7)  248.19<br />
(8)  256.01<br />
(9)  261.15</p>

<p>It is seen, from looking at this table, that all divergences from the
general rule have stopped. Cards 1, 2, and 3 each take less time than
any of the 4, 5, 6 group, and 7 is faster than 8 and 9. So the evidence
seems very strong that it takes longer to count complex than
simple figures. Should one object that the difference is extremely
small, a few thousandths of a second, and that thus a slight error in
one test might invalidate the result, we reply that the time which is
given is the time in which we count just one figure of the given pattern,
and that thus of course the difference between counting two different
figures must be very small. Moreover there has been a remarkable
agreement of the tests taken at different times. It is not a case of
finding 1, 2, and 3 counted faster one day and 4, 5, and 6 counted
faster the next, but 1, 2, and 3 are counted faster nearly every time.
Occasionally 1 will take longer than one of the 4, 5, 6 group. And
extremely seldom is there a case where the average of 1, 2, and 3 is
not less than that of 4, 5, and 6.</p>

<p>The experiment seems to have proven that it takes a longer time to
count a row of complex figures than a similar row of simple figures.
<em>The complex figure exercises a retarding effect upon the eye as it sweeps
along.</em> There is a greater amount of sensory stimulation, consequently
a greater amount of motor excitement. This motor excitement does
not act in harmony with the motor activity which impels the eyes
along, but has a somewhat antagonistic effect. The eye is held more
by the complex figure; it is a greater effort to withdraw the gaze to look
at the next figure. A certain interest, as we say, on the psychological<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</a></span>
side tends to hold one to the figure looked at. This interest is greater
(other things being equal) the greater the complexity of the figure. The
nervous processes involved in counting, though admittedly in very
small degree, are thus inhibited by the complexity of the figure and
act more slowly.</p>

<p>Since the preceding experiments seem to show that reactions on
optical impressions are different according as the figures are more or
less complex, it would seem that we ought to be able to measure by
graphic methods the reactions to visual fields of varying grades of
complexity and in this way to demonstrate their different motor powers.</p>

<p>A Porter kymograph was used on which to register the reactions.
Resting on the top of the drum, and revolving with it, was a circular
band of white paper, upon which were pasted the different figures to
be observed. A screen was placed in front of the kymograph, thus
concealing the figures; but at their level was a little square window
in the screen, which, when the eye was placed in the proper position,
allowed the subject to see one of the figures but nothing more. A few
inches in front of this window was an eye-rest which kept the eye properly
placed. A tambour received the movement from the subject
and communicated it to a straw which made a scratch on the smoked
paper which covered the drum.</p>

<p>The figures used in this experiment form two series, one, composed
of geometrical figures, varying in complexity from a circle to a very
complex figure consisting of many overlapping squares, triangles, etc.,
and the other composed of colored figures varying in complexity from
a simple square of one color to a very complex mixture of various colors.
The area of the visual field is about the same in all cases,&mdash;an inch
square. The geometrical figures were formed of black lines on a white
background. The figures used are shown in the accompanying illustrations.</p>

<p>The subject would be seated in front of the screen, his eye at the
eye-rest a few inches in front of the window in the screen, and the
forefinger of the right hand on the tambour, which is to the right of
and behind the screen, and thus not seen while the eye is at the rest.
Then as the drum revolves and brings a figure in front of the window,
the subject observes this figure carefully, and when it is all in the field
of vision he presses down with his forefinger, thus producing a curve
on the drum surface. <em>He tries to make the same finger-movement every
time</em>, whatever the figure at the window may be. But his attention is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</a></span>
not to be too much taken up with the making of the movement, for he
must be closely observing the figure. If he looks at the figure until he
observes its characteristics clearly and then turns his attention from
this to the finger-movement, it is evident that the optical sensation
would not have much effect upon the movement. The movement
must be performed while his interest in the figure is highest. Now,
after a little practice, any one can accustom himself to make a certain
definite movement in about the same way every time, and he can then
agree that he shall make this movement as a reaction to a given stimulation.
Then when the stimulus comes he makes the movement without
any longer thinking of the character of the movement. It has become,
to a certain extent, automatic and can look out for itself.</p>

<p>This is the state into which I have tried to get my subjects. Their
whole attention is to be taken up with the seeing of the figures in the
window, and to these figures they are to react as automatically as possible.
Thus, though finger-movements are usually voluntary, all the
capricious character of voluntary action will be removed here, and if
the stimulus is the same in all cases, the reaction tends to assume the
form of a uniform movement. There is, then, a chance to see the influence
of different optical stimuli upon this action.</p>

<p>Six different geometrical figures were seen at each revolution of the
drum and six reactions given by the subject. Between figures a white
surface would occupy the field of vision. The simple and complex
figures were distributed so that the subject never knew what kind of
a figure would come next. The purpose of the experiment was kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</a></span>
as much as possible from the knowledge of the subjects; but some,
knowing my general problem, surmised quite correctly my main object
here.</p>

<p>Ten revolutions were made at each sitting, thus causing the subject
to react ten times to each figure. Then a new drum paper was taken
and the case with the colored figures placed upon it. This had five
colored figures, and ten revolutions were made also in this case. Thus,
in all, in any one day, the subject would make one hundred and ten of
these finger-movements.</p>

<p>Since we have in all these experiments tried to find out in the different
figures merely differences in the <em>amount</em> of the reaction, and not
differences in the character of the reaction, we shall keep up this
method here. Now a stronger reaction makes a higher curve, and since
the drum is all the while revolving, and since the higher the curve,
other things being equal, the longer it takes, the stronger reaction will
also make a wider curve. So it would seem that if we wish to observe
the differences in the amounts of reaction the most natural course to
pursue would be to measure the heights and widths of the curves we
have registered. This accordingly has been done.</p>

<p>In our discussion of these measurements let us, then, first, take up
the curve heights, and of these, those of the geometrical figures which
we call <em>U</em>, <em>V</em>, <em>W</em>, <em>X</em>, <em>Y</em>, <em>Z</em>. The height is measured from a base-line
[drawn by revolving the drum after the subject has taken his finger
from the tambour] to the highest point reached. These measurements
are taken from two hundred reactions to each figure, divided among
seven different subjects.</p>

<p>It is seen from these results that, although the subjects differ, the
height of the curve varies directly with the complexity of the figure.
The order of the figures, which we get by measuring the height of the
curves and then putting that figure with the highest curve first, with
the next highest second, and so on, is exactly the same order in which
we should put them if we were asked to put the most complex first, the
next second, and so on. Though the individual subjects may vary
somewhat from this rule, when they are all grouped together there
are no exceptions.</p>

<p>The variations of the reactions with the different subjects may be
shown very clearly in the following way, where the different figures are
in the left-hand side arranged in order of descending complexity. "1st
place," etc., refer to the order of arrangement of the figures by the
different subjects as shown in preceding tables. Thus, <em>Z</em>, 3 times, 1st
place, means that three subjects have in the average a higher curve
for <em>Z</em> than for any other figure.</p>

<p>One can see at a glance from this, how, as the figures decrease in
complexity, they take their position further on in the series. If a diagonal
is drawn from the upper left-hand corner to the lower right, it will
pass through or near the larger numbers in the table, thus showing
that the figures belong in the ordered series in the places already
shown.</p>

<p>Here, as before, in the case of the heights, it is seen that though the
order is different with the different subjects, yet the general tendency is
to place the most complex figures first and the simplest last. The most
simple figure <em>Y</em> never comes in front of the fifth place except with subject
C, who places it first. This exception may be ascribed to the fact
that this subject, on account of his going away, did not have so many
tests. In fact only one day's work of 10 reactions for each figure is
recorded, and it is but natural that some variations from the standard
should occur in his case.</p>

<p>Here we again see the large numbers on a line from the upper left-hand
to the lower right-hand corner.</p>

<p>The only difference, it is seen, is that the positions of <em>V</em> and <em>X</em> are
reversed in the two series. Such a change would on our principle be
fairly likely to occur, since <em>V</em> and <em>X</em> are figures near to each other in
complexity and the motor effects are very similar.</p>

<p>A theoretical word may close our report.</p>

<p>The growth of biology and physiology has tended to show that there
is no break in the nervous mechanism. The stimulus goes to the brain
and out through motor channels to muscles, glands, etc. The nervous
current does not wait in the brain for the permission of the mind to
leave on its journey to a muscle nor does it need mental reÃ«nforcement.
The nervous current as a whole is a unity. The nervous system is
a physiological instrument for producing the appropriate reaction
to a certain stimulus. In the unicellular organism there is no nervous
system, but the protoplasm receives the stimulus and produces the
reaction. As we go up in the animal series a differentiation is seen to
be present in the organism. Some parts are more concerned with the
receiving of stimuli and others with the approach toward or withdrawal
from the stimulating object. There is a division of labor. The nervous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</a></span>
system is developed as a means of rapid communication between
the different parts, but this communication is a physiological one. The
stimulus sets up a chemical action in the sensory organ which is transmitted
along the nervous path to the motor organ which is caused to
react. As we ascend the animal series the differentiation becomes
greater and greater, and consequently the means of communication
must become more and more complex. So trunk lines are formed
which lead to a centre, and from this centre again go out main lines
which divide and subdivide until the muscles are reached. The centre
acts as a kind of automatic switch-board.</p>

<p>Accepting such a view of the nervous system it must be granted
that different stimulations would produce different reactions. It was
my aim in the experimental work which has been described to show
that this is true. And while much work has already been done in showing
that different kinds, or different amounts of stimulation produce
differences in reactions, it seemed important to demonstrate also that
mere differences in the complexity of the stimulus bring about differences
in the reaction. So the experiment of counting figures of different
complexity was entered upon, and we found that it took longer to
count figures the more complex they were in spite of the fact that the
act of counting seems always the same. The question is how must
the fact that counting becomes slower and slower, as the figures become
more complex, be interpreted?</p>

<p>When we count a row of figures, the eyes do not move along at
a regular uniform rate, but make a quick jump from one figure to the
next, halt a moment, make another jump, and so on. Now, I think
the principal difference comes in with the figures of different complexity
in the time the eye halts at each figure. The halt is longer the
more complex the figure is. It is well known that any visual object
which stimulates the retina is brought by a reflex movement of the eye
to the place of clearest vision. Of two objects stimulating the eye at the
same time, the more pronounced one will produce the reflex and will
hold the eye longer than a weaker stimulus. Similarly here, the more
complex figure produces a stronger reflex and holds the eye longer than
the simple figure. This is repeated at every figure in the series.</p>

<p>The complex figures have more features about them, all of which by
way of the retina and optic nerve are represented in the cortex and thus
more cortical cells are involved, which in turn produce a stronger stimulation
of the muscles which move the eye in the proper way to see the
figure, and thus the eye is held more strongly by the complex than by
the simple figure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</a></span></p>

<p>Again in the second experiment, the subject reacts more strongly to
the complex as shown already in explaining the first experiment and
for the same reasons. It might be said that in looking at the colored
figures, <em>e. g.</em>, that since the same amount of retina is stimulated, the
reaction ought to be the same. But we may presume that the complex
figure, on account of the different shapes and contrasts on its surface,
will more variously affect the same amount of retina and that the nervous
currents sent to the cortex will, many of them, be stronger than
those from the simple figure and will thus cause the cortical cells to be
more strongly excited, or by a process of irradiation the stimulation
will spread to adjoining cells and thus finally more cells be stimulated.
However this may be, the amount of discharge into motor cells is certainly
greater and the muscular reaction, therefore, also greater.</p>

<p>The interesting side of our results is thus given in the fact that we
have here two activities&mdash;counting with highest speed and making
hand-movements of certain length&mdash;which are performed every time
with exactly the same intention and with the subjective impression
of equal result, and which yet show marked differences according to
the complexity of the psycho-physical stimuli. It is a new contribution
to our knowledge of the independent motor power of ideas.</p>

<p>Since the behavior of an animal is conditioned by its senses, it is
extremely important that the comparative psychologist should have
accurate and detailed knowledge of the sense-impressions received by
his subjects. Knowledge of the so-called "special senses" does not
suffice for the satisfactory description of behavior, for there are several
other kinds of sense-data of equal or even greater importance than
those of the five special senses. As investigation of the subject progresses
the banefulness of the notion that all sense-experience is summed
up in "the five special senses" becomes more and more evident. For
the comparative psychologist the senses are not five, six, eight, or ten,
but as numerous as are the kinds of sense-data which condition animal
activities. There can be no doubt that many of the lower animals are
largely dependent upon senses which are not included in the conventional
special sense list. The contention that certain organs which are
commonly recognized as sensory in function, the cristÃ¦ acusticÃ¦ of the
ear, for instance, are merely reflex control organs, has little weight in
this connection, for every sense-organ is part of a motor control mechanism,
and so far as we are able to judge from available evidence
each has as an accompaniment of its functioning a mode of sensation.
If there are two kinds of peripheral organs in connection with the
afferent nerves, namely, those whose functioning has sensation for
an accompaniment and those in which motor control is the sole
phenomenon, it is high time that the fact were definitely known.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[Pg 546]</a></span></p>

<p>Even a thoroughly accurate knowledge of the general condition of
the senses in a particular phylum, genus, or species may be of trifling
value in the study of the behavior of a given individual, for within
these groups the state of development and relative importance of a
sense may differ strikingly. Herrick,<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> in his admirable investigation
of the sense of taste in fishes, has rendered comparative psychology an
important service by showing that even a highly developed sense may
be of markedly different value in the associative life of different species.
The cat-fish, according to Professor Herrick's observations, obtains
its food primarily by the aid of taste-impressions, the hake by the aid
of touch, and the sea-robin chiefly by means of vision. All three of the
senses mentioned are possessed by each of the fishes, yet their values
differ so widely that an understanding of the habits and associative
processes of any one of the species would be impossible except in the
light of just such facts as Herrick has discovered. Clearly, then, we
must know the relative importance of the various sense-impressions
received by an animal before we can discuss its behavior or psychic
characteristics intelligently.</p>

<p>Furthermore, if behavior is to be serviceably described in terms of
stimuli and physiological conditions it is necessary first of all to
recognize that an animal responds to a situation, not to any one independent
and isolated stimulus. Every situation, to be sure, may be
analyzed into its component simple stimuli, but the influence of each
and all of these stimuli is conditioned by the situation. Too often in
our accounts of an animal's behavior we name some one stimulus as
the condition of the reaction and entirely neglect the situation, without
which the stimulus would have been of quite different value to the
animal. For any given stimulus other external and internal stimuli
constitute an environment. The complete description of a reaction
demands knowledge of all the stimuli which enter into the situation
and of their mutual relations of interference or supplementation. A
frog which in its native habitat and undisturbed by an unusual situation
would react violently to the light touch of a stick may give no sign
of reaction to the same stimulus when a human being stands nearby.
The influence of the tactual stimulus has been changed entirely by the
simultaneous appearance of visual, olfactory, and possibly still other
sense-data (man). The animal reacts not to the touch alone, but to
this stimulus as part of a certain situation. The general effect of a situation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</a></span>
we often speak of as excitement, timidity, etc. These are words for
which must be substituted in our accounts of animal behavior accurate
descriptions of the situations. Experimental studies prove that an
animal must become thoroughly accustomed to the general situation
in which it is to be observed before the influence of any particular
condition can be studied to advantage.</p>

<p>Only a few of the important reactions of an animal to either external
or internal stimuli are visible to the casual observer, and many of
them can be detected only by the employment of indirect methods.
Frequently the lack of a visible motor response to a new situation is
good evidence of a fundamentally important reaction. The death-feigning
opossum, crustacean, or insect, truly reacts by becoming motionless.
As Whitman<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> has shown in the case of the leech it is as hazardous
to judge of the degree of sensitiveness of another animal solely
on the basis of our own as it is to maintain that lower animals possess
only the senses which are ours. Varied, indirect and delicate methods
are necessary in the investigation of the senses, as the results of the
experiments to be described below help to prove.</p>

<p>It is my purpose in this paper to call attention to and emphasize the
importance of studying stimuli in their mutual relations of interference
and supplementation. This I shall do by presenting the results of an
investigation of the behavior of the green frog. I shall discuss briefly,
first, the sense-data received by the animal, their relative importance,
significance, and mutual relations, and, next, the phenomena of reÃ«nforcement
and inhibition.</p>

<p>The following sensory reactions have been observed in the frog, but
most of them have not been studied with care: olfactory, temperature,
visual, tactual, equilibrational, and auditory. It is my purpose to investigate
each of these senses in such fashion that we shall know the
receptive capacity of the animal. Thus far I have completed only the
work on auditory reactions, but the chemical and temperature senses
and vision will be discussed in similar fashion later.</p>

<p>At present there is little known concerning the chemical senses.
Unpublished observations made by Mr. Sherwin in this laboratory
indicate the existence of olfactory sensitiveness to camphor, iodine,
and several other strong stimuli. The reactions to the stimuli were
slow, however, and there is no reason to believe that the sense of smell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</a></span>
is of great importance to the animal. Of taste barely more is known
than that it is present.</p>

<p>There is marked sensitiveness to variations in temperature, as I
have demonstrated by preliminary test experiments, but the limits,
distribution, and significance of this sensitiveness remain to be investigated.
I am not aware that the existence of temperature spots has been
determined. In connection with a study of the reactions of frogs to
light Torelle<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> discovered that the animals suddenly become inactive
and usually attempt to bury themselves when brought into a temperature
of 8&deg; to 10&deg; C. This reaction is prompt and definite; its value to
an animal which hibernates is evident, yet one would scarcely anticipate
the suddenness and regularity with which it occurs.</p>

<p>My studies of habit-formation and reaction-time<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> have revealed the
importance of vision in the life of the frog. Perception of movement
appears to be of far greater value to the animal than perception of
form or color. The spectral colors are discriminated in all probability,
for the animals react very differently to those of the blue end than to
those of the red. According to Torelle blue is preferred to red. There
is evidence that red has a higher stimulating value than blue, and the
apparent avoidance of red in Torelle's experiments may be due to this
fact. None of the work with which I am familiar demonstrates that
the suspected color-reactions are due to stimulation of the eye. They
may be due to stimulation of the skin, for Parker<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> has shown that the
reactions of <em>Rana pipiens</em> to light are due to stimulation of the sink
as well as of the eyes, or they may even be due to intensity instead of
color.</p>

<p>The tactual-auditory sense series is better known and also, it would
appear, better developed than the chemical series. A large portion
of the body surface of the green frog is keenly sensitive to mechanical
stimulation, and Steinach<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> by measurement of electrical changes in the
nerves of the skin has discovered the existence of "touch spots." His
method, which is ingenious, promises to be of considerable value in
the objective investigation of the senses, but it involves operations on
the subject which inevitably destroy the normal condition of the sense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[Pg 549]</a></span></p>

<p>According to Steinach we have in the negative variation in the electrical
condition of nerves during stimulation a phenomenon which
may be used in the determination of the threshold of stimulation as
well as in the investigation of irritability. In a previous paper<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> I have
discussed the associational rÃ´le of tactual impressions as well as the
tactual reaction-time. All my observations lead me to believe that
touch is a highly developed and important sense in the green frog.</p>

<p>Of the senses intermediate between touch and hearing that of equilibration
has been most discussed. Certainly there is good reason to
suppose that the sense-organs of the semicircular canals of the ear furnish
the animal with impressions of position, movement, and possibly
also of direction. Further study of the tactual-auditory senses of frogs
may indicate the existence of conditions similar to those discovered
by Parker in certain fishes, in which, as he remarks, "the skin, lateral
line organs and ears represent, figuratively speaking, three generations
of sense-organs. The oldest is the skin stimulated by varying pressures,
such as are produced by irregular currents, and capable of initiating
equilibrational responses. From the skin have been derived the lateral
line organs stimulated by water vibrations of low rate, and also significant
for equilibration. Finally, from the lateral line organs have come
the ears stimulated by water vibrations of a high rate and important
for equilibration. The ear, unlike the skin and lateral line organs, is
differentiated for its two functions, the sacculus for hearing, the
utriculus for equilibration."<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>The sense of hearing remains to be considered. My attention was
first drawn to this subject by failure to obtain motor reactions to sounds
in the investigation of the time-relations of the neural processes of the
green frog. Although a large number of sounds of different qualities,
pitches, and intensities were employed, no visible motor reactions were
observed. This led me to seek the significance of what appeared to be
either a surprising lack of sensitiveness to changes in the environment
which would naturally be expected to stimulate the animal, or an interesting
and important case of the inhibition of reaction to auditory
stimuli. This suggested the question, Are frogs deaf, or do they under
certain conditions completely inhibit their usual reactions to sound?</p>

<p>In the literature on the senses and reactions of frogs I have found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[Pg 550]</a></span>
nothing which contributes importantly to our knowledge of the sense
of hearing. Most of the investigations which deal with the ear are concerned
with the equilibrational and orientational functions of the labyrinth
organs, and have nothing whatever to say about hearing. In the
natural histories the existence of a well-developed sense of hearing is
usually assumed, and numerous instances of what are supposed to be
reactions to sound are cited. It is to be noted, however, that none of the
observations in these popular works furnishes satisfactory proof of the
exclusion of the influence of visual stimuli. Among the few references
to frog audition of which I have knowledge, the only one which seems
worthy of special notice is that of Gaupp in his Anatomie des
Frosches. Since his few paragraphs sum up the state of our knowledge
on the subject, while at the same time furnishing an illustration of the
assumption of hearing on the basis of analogy, I present the substance
of them in free and slightly abbreviated translation.</p>

<p>"The labyrinth organ has an acoustic and non-acoustic (static)
function. For these two functions, according to the leading if not
generally accepted view, entirely different portions of the organ are in
question, and since the non-acoustic is attributed to the three <em>Cristae
acusticae ampullarum</em> and the three <em>Maculae</em> (<em>M. recessus utriculi</em>,
<em>M. sacculi</em>, <em>M. lagenae</em>), there remain for the acoustic function only the
<em>Papilla basilaris</em> and the <em>Macula neglecta</em>. It is not certain, however,
that the non-acoustic organs do not participate in the acoustic function.</p>

<p>"With regard to the acoustic sense of the frog nothing exact is
known. That it exists, and that in good development, is certain. The
existence of the drum and columella, and the fact that frogs have a
voice are unmistakeable proofs of hearing. The participation of the
<em>Papilla basilaris</em> in acoustic functions is rendered certain by comparative
anatomical studies: the <em>Papilla basilaris</em> is the nerve end-organ
from which, in the mammalia, the undoubtedly acoustic organ of
Corti arises. From analogy of structure we may also infer an acoustic
function in the <em>Macula neglecta</em>: on this, as on the <em>Papilla basilaris</em>,
there is a simple tectorial membrane, and further the <em>Pars neglecta</em>,
like the <em>Pars basilaris</em>, has a strong thick wall which only in a limited
region, namely, where it approaches a part of the perilymphatic space,
is markedly thinner." (For fish Breuer (1891) has already stated that if
they really hear&mdash;which is proved&mdash;the <em>Macula neglecta</em> alone can
come into consideration in connection with the function, for there is no
<em>Papilla basilaris</em> in fishes, and the six other nerve end-organs apparently
serve the non-acoustic function.)<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</a></span></p>

<p>As the green frog does not respond visibly to sounds under experimental
conditions, I found it necessary to employ indirect
methods in the study of audition. By observing the influence of
sounds on respiration and on the reactions to certain electrical,
tactual, and visual stimuli, I obtained results which, since they have
already been described in detail elsewhere,<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> may be summarized
here as follows:</p>

<p>1. Observation of frogs in their natural habitat shows that they
are stimulated by sounds, but the sense of hearing apparently serves
rather as a warning sense which modifies reactions to other simultaneous
or succeeding stimuli than as a control for definite auditory
motor reactions.</p>

<p>2. Experimental tests prove that sounds modify the frog's reactions
to visual and tactual stimuli. When the sound accompanies
the visual or tactual stimulus it serves to reÃ«nforce the reaction to
the other stimulus, but when given alone it never causes a motor reaction.</p>

<p>3. The green frog responds to sounds made in the air, whether
the tympana be in the air or in water. There is some evidence that
the influence of auditory stimuli is most marked when the drum is
half-submerged in water. The influence of sounds upon tactual reactions
is evident when the frog is submerged in water to a depth of
4 cm.</p>

<p>4. Sounds varying in pitch from those of 50 to 10,000 vibrations
per second affect the frog. The most striking results were obtained
by the use of an electric bell with a metal gong. With this sound in
connection with a weak tactual stimulus a maximum reaction may
often be obtained even when either stimulus alone causes no perceivable
reaction.</p>

<p>5. Sounds modify the reactions of the frog after tympana and
columellÃ¦ are removed. Cutting of the eighth cranial nerves causes
disappearance of the influence of sound. It is clear, then, that the
reactions to sounds are really auditory reactions and that the sense
of hearing in the frog is fairly well developed, although there is little
evidence of such a sense in the motor reactions of the animal.</p>

<p>6. Experiments during the spring months show marked influence of
sounds for both males and females, whereas experiments made during
the winter indicate a much diminished sensitiveness to auditory
stimuli in both sexes, but especially in the male.</p>

<p>In studying the various influences of complication of stimuli in
the frog, I have used two methods: the measurement of reaction-time
and of the amount of reaction. The reaction-time results will be
presented first.</p>

<p>Reaction-time to electric stimulation of the skin was studied with
special attention to the influence of other stimuli which were given in
definite temporal relation to the electric stimulus. A Hipp chronoscope,
controlled by a Cattell's falling screen, served as a time-measuring
apparatus. The other essentials of the apparatus were a reaction-box,
and devices for giving the stimuli and indicating the reaction.
On the bottom of the reaction-box a series of wires were so placed
that an electric stimulus could be given to the frog resting upon them
by the closing of a key in the hands of the experimenter. In preparation
for each experiment the frog was placed upon these open circuit
wires in such a position that the weight of its body pressed upon a
delicate spring in the floor of the box, thus causing the chronoscope
circuit to be completed. The forward jump of the frog in response
to stimulation caused the breaking of this circuit by the release of the
spring upon which the animal rested. When all was in readiness for
an experiment the chronoscope was started, and a key closed which
simultaneously gave an electric stimulus to the frog and completed
a circuit which caused the chronoscope record to begin. The stimulus
consisted of a current from one or more "Mesco" dry cells.
The motor reaction of the frog broke the chronoscope circuit, thus
causing the chronoscope record to stop. It was then possible for
the experimenter to read from the dials of the chronoscope the time,
in thousandths of seconds, intervening between stimulus and reaction
(reaction-time). In case of additional stimuli in connection with
the electric, various simple devices were introduced to meet the
demands of the experiments. These will be described in connection
with the statement of results in each case.</p>

<p><em>Electric and photic stimuli.</em> A photic stimulus was given from one
to two seconds before the electric stimulus by the turning on of a
sixteen-candle-power incandescent light, which was placed thirty cm.
in front of the frog in the case of one series of experiments and fifteen
cm. above it in another. The light uniformly inhibited reaction to
the electric stimulus, as is shown by the results of Table 1.</p>

<p>The inhibitory influence of light depends upon the intensity of
the electric stimulus. Even a very strong light will not cause much
retardation of reaction to a three or four cell current. As the strength
of the electric stimulus decreases the delay of reaction increases,
until finally there is complete inhibition. At this point, an electric
stimulus, to which the frog would react almost invariably when there
is no disturbing condition, will fail to cause reaction in the presence
of a sudden increase in light intensity.</p>

<p>Merzbacher<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> states that the leg reflex of a frog, so placed that
its legs hang free in the air, is greater in response to a given cutaneous
stimulus in darkness than in daylight.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p><em>Electric and visual stimuli</em> (moving object). For the purpose of
determining the effect upon reaction-time to an electric stimulus of
stimulation of the eye by a rapidly moving object, experiments were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[Pg 554]</a></span>
made in which, as in the case of electric and photic stimuli, reactions
to electric stimulus alone and to the visual and electric were observed
alternately. Thus in the case of each pair of reactions it was possible
to note whether the visual stimulus shortened or lengthened the
reaction-time. The visual stimulus was given by quickly moving
a finger before a window in the reaction-box.</p>

<p>Two series of twenty pairs of reactions each were taken with each
of two frogs. In the first series the finger was suddenly moved across
the window and the electric stimulus was given either simultaneously
or a small fraction of a second later. It was impossible to arrange for
accurate measurement of the temporal relations of the two stimuli
in the case of these tests. In the second series the finger was moved
back and forth before the opening in the reaction-box for an interval
of at least a second before the electric stimulus was given.</p>

<p>These experiments, which were in the nature of preliminary tests,
yielded the following results. When the stimuli were given almost
simultaneously the visual reÃ«nforced the electric as was indicated by
a shortening of the reaction-time. As appears in the upper part of
Table 2, the average time of forty reactions, twenty for each frog,
to the electric stimulus was 148<sup>&#963;</sup>,<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> and to the same stimulus when it
followed the visual 128<sup>&#963;</sup>. Furthermore, examination of the several
pairs of reactions shows, as is indicated in the table, that there were
twenty-seven cases in which the visual stimulus caused shortening of
the reaction-time (reÃ«nforcement of the electric stimulus) to thirteen
in which it caused lengthening (inhibition). When the visual stimulus
preceded the electric by at least a second, the reaction-time to the
electric stimulus was greatly lengthened. The averages are 150<sup>&#963;</sup> for
the electric stimulus alone, 178<sup>&#963;</sup> when it was preceded by the visual.
In this series there are twenty-five cases of inhibition to fourteen of
reÃ«nforcement.</p>

<p><em>Electric and visual stimuli</em> (moving red disc). The indications of
the importance of the temporal relations of stimuli, so far as reaction-time
results are concerned, furnished by these crude preliminary
observations led to a more accurate study of the subject. A revolving
disc, which moved at the rate of one revolution per minute, was so
arranged that at a certain point it closed an electric circuit in which
a magnet had been placed. This magnet attracted a steel arm at the
end of which a disc of red cardboard 12 mm. in diameter was suspended.
With the making of the circuit the steel arm was drawn
downward suddenly and the red disc, by reason of the vibrations of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</a></span>
the arm moved rapidly back and forth in front of a window in the
reaction-box. In this way the moving object was exposed to view
about ten cm. to the right and three cm. in front of the right eye of
the frog. The revolving disc, a fraction of a second later, completed
the electric stimulus circuit. Thus both stimuli were given automatically,
at such an interval apart as the experimenter desired. In
the two series of results now to be described the intervals were 0.1
and 0.5 second respectively.</p>

<p>These series consisted of twenty-five pairs of reactions each, with
two animals. The results of the series are presented separately, in
the lower half of Table 2, because the experiments which constitute
them were separated by a period of three weeks. It is to be noted that
these results agree fully with those of the preliminary series. The
visual stimulus of a moving red disc, given 0.1 second before a 2 cell
electric stimulus, reÃ«nforces the electric reaction, <em>i. e.</em>, it shortens the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</a></span>
time of reaction. The same visual stimulus given 0.5 second before
tends to inhibit the electric reaction, <em>i. e.</em>, it lengthens the time of
reaction.</p>

<p><em>Tactual and auditory stimuli.</em> Since in the frog auditory stimuli
under experimental conditions seldom if ever cause visible motor
reactions, the study of the influence of this mode of stimulation upon
the reactions to other simultaneous or succeeding stimuli is of special
interest. In the investigation of the relations of auditory stimulation
to other forms of reaction <em>amount</em> of reaction instead of <em>reaction-time</em>
was taken as a measure of the influence of the stimulus. By a method
the details of which may be most easily understood by reference to
the plan of the apparatus in Figure 1, the influence of auditory
stimuli on the leg-movement induced by tactual stimulation was
observed.</p>

<p>In these experiments the frog sat astride a wooden support, held in
position by linen bands over the back and a wire screen cap over
the head. The hind legs hung free, and any movement of one of
them in response to a stimulus could be read in millimetres by reference
to a scale on the wooden support. This method of measuring
the value of a stimulus in terms of leg-reflex has been used by several
investigators&mdash;most recently by Merzbacher.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> I have found it desirable,
as did Merzbacher, to observe the movements of a shadow
of the leg on the scale and thus read the amount of movement, rather
than to watch the leg itself and attempt to project it upon the scale.</p>

<p>As is indicated in Fig. 1, the auditory and tactual stimuli were
given automatically by means of a swinging pendulum, <em>P</em>, which
was held in position by the magnet <em>a</em> until released by the experimenter.
Early in its swing the pendulum turned the key, <em>m</em>, thus
completing a circuit which caused the auditory stimulus to be given;
later in the swing the key, <em>n</em>, was turned, and the tactual stimulus thus
given through the magnetic release of the lever, <em>l</em>. The interval
between the auditory and the tactual stimuli could be varied from
0 to 2&#733; by changing the position of the key, <em>n</em>. For intervals over 1&#733; it
was necessary to arrange this key so that the tactual stimulus was
given at some time during the return swing of the pendulum.</p>

<p>The auditory stimulus used was either the sound of a quick hammer
blow (momentary stimulus of Series I), or the ringing of an electric
bell for a certain length of time (prolonged stimulus of Series II). In
Fig. 1 the bell is shown. It was placed eighty cm. from the frog,
and in order that the influence of vibration of the experiment table
might be avoided it was suspended from the pendulum frame. When
the hammer was used it was placed sixty cm. from the frog, on the
pendulum table. The holder for the frog and the tactual apparatus
occupied a separate table which was not disturbed by the jars of the
pendulum table.</p>

<p>The tactual stimulus was given by a rubber cone, <em>T</em>, two mm. in
diameter at its apex. This rubber point, after the electric release of
the lever to which it was attached, struck the frog at the middle point
of a line drawn between the posterior margins of the tympana. The
intensity of the stimulus could be varied by weighting the lever, <em>l</em>, at <em>w</em>.</p>

<p>All experiments were made with the green frog, <em>Rana clamata</em>
Daudin. The reactions were taken regularly at half-minute intervals
in pairs: first, a tactual stimulus reaction, then an auditory-tactual
reaction. Ten, fifty, or one hundred pairs constituted a series. So
far as the condition of the frog is concerned there seems to be nothing
undesirable in long series, for fatigue does not appear, and so long
as the animal is kept moist and in an unconstrained position, it continues
to react normally, and without frequent struggles to escape.
The advantage for the purposes of this investigation of taking the
reactions in pairs, rather than taking separate series of reactions for
each stimulus or combination of stimuli, is obvious. It enables us to
compare directly the reactions of each pair, in other words those
reactions which took place under most nearly identical conditions,
and to note at once whether the auditory stimulus reÃ«nforced or
inhibited the tactual reaction.</p>

<p>During a series the intensity of the tactual stimulus was changed as
conditions demanded, but for any one pair of reactions it was always
the same. It not infrequently happened that an intensity which at
first caused merely a slight movement of the leg, later in the series
uniformly brought about a maximal contraction, or the reverse might
be true, and inasmuch as a maximal reaction to the tactual stimulus
alone left no opportunity for judging of the influence of the auditory
stimulus, when it was given in addition to the tactual, it was always
necessary in such cases so to alter the intensity of the tactual stimulus
that a medium reaction resulted.</p>

<p>The frogs, after being placed in the saddle-like holder and held
firmly for a few seconds, seldom struggled very much, but if bound
tightly they became irresponsive to the stimuli.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> It was, therefore,
necessary after they had quieted down to loosen the bands which held
them in position. For the purpose of excluding the influence of visual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[Pg 559]</a></span>
stimuli a wire screen cap covered with black cloth was put over the
head; this served to keep the animal in position as well as to exclude
visual stimulation.</p>

<p><em>a. Momentary auditory stimulation.</em> Four frogs were used for a
study of the influence of the momentary sound produced by a hammer
blow, and for each of these animals fifty pairs of reactions were
recorded in series each day. The temporal relation of the stimuli was
changed daily during a week of experimentation: the results therefore
consist of fifty pairs of reactions with each frog for each of the following
seven intervals: (1) Auditory and tactual stimuli simultaneous,
(2) auditory .25&#733; before tactual, (3) auditory .45&#733; before, (4) auditory
.15&#733; before, (5) auditory .65&#733; before, (6) auditory .35&#733; before,
(7) auditory .90&#733; before. The intervals were used in the experiments
in the above order to avoid the formation of the definite habits of
reaction which regular increase in the interval would have favored.</p>

<p>Typical of the results with all the animals are the following (Table
3) which were obtained with No. 1, a male. The figures in each case
indicate the average of fifty reactions. ReÃ«nforcement and inhibition
are expressed in terms of the tactual reaction, <em>i. e.</em>, the auditory-tactual
reaction is so many per cent greater (reÃ«nforcement) or less
(inhibition) than the tactual. In the tables reÃ«nforcement is indicated
by the + sign; inhibition by the - sign. In the last column of the
table is given the number of reactions that were reÃ«nforced or inhibited.
This was determined by comparing directly the reactions of
each pair. Cases in which the two reactions were the same were distributed
equally between the two classes: tactual reactions reÃ«nforced
by auditory stimulus, and tactual reactions inhibited by auditory
stimulus. Assuming that the auditory stimulus was without effect
upon the tactual reaction, the number of reactions in these two classes
would be approximately the same, hence all auditory-tactual reactions
over half in a series, <em>i. e.</em>, over twenty-five, which are greater than
the corresponding tactual reactions, are reÃ«nforced reactions, and can
be taken as a measure of the reÃ«nforcing influence of the auditory
stimulus. In the same manner all reactions over half which show
inhibition can be taken as a measure of the inhibitory value of the
auditory stimulus.</p>

<p>As preliminary tests described in an earlier paper<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> furnished
evidence of sex-differences, it is worth while to compare the results
given by the males and females in these experiments with momentary
auditory stimulation. For purposes of comparison I have presented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[Pg 560]</a></span>
in Table 4 the reÃ«nforcement-inhibition values given by the males
and females for each interval. Column one contains the value of the
auditory-tactual reaction in terms of the tactual reaction; column two,
the number of reactions in excess of half which were reÃ«nforced or
inhibited.</p>

<p>In these results two striking differences between the males and
females appear: first, the reÃ«nforcement is not so great for the females
as for the males; second, inhibition appears earlier and continues
longer with the females than with the males. The average reÃ«nforcement
with simultaneous stimuli is 82.5% for the males against 58.0%
for the females. Inhibition begins to appear in case of the females
when the interval between the stimuli is .25&#733; to .35&#733;; in case of the
males it appears between .35&#733; and .45&#733;. Finally at .90&#733; interval
inhibition is slightly greater for the females.</p>

<p>Although the exact significance of these facts is unknown, it is not
improbable that they are indicative of fundamentally important sex-differences
in reaction to sound. The males among frogs are usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[Pg 561]</a></span>
the vocalists, although in some species the females also croak. Moreover,
in case of the green frog the tympanum of the male is much
larger than that of the female. The results presented would seem
to indicate that certain sounds stimulate the males to activity, whereas
they inhibit activity in the females.</p>

<p>Graphically represented, the results of the momentary auditory
stimulus experiments with frogs Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4 are as follows:</p>

<p>The curves are all plotted by the method which will now be described
in connection with Fig. 2. This figure presents the reÃ«nforcement-inhibition
curves for the males No. 1 (solid line in the figure) and
No. 3 (broken line). If in this figure we let the zero-point on the
ordinates represent the value of the reaction to the tactual stimulus
when given alone, then the value of the reaction to the auditory-tactual
stimuli would be represented at some point above the zero-point
if this reaction was greater than the tactual reaction (reÃ«nforcement),
and below the zero-point if the reaction was less than the
tactual (inhibition). Since one of our chosen measures of reÃ«nforcement
and inhibition is the amount, in per cent of tactual reaction, by
which the auditory-tactual reaction exceeds or falls short of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[Pg 562]</a></span>
tactual reaction, such a curve of reÃ«nforcement-inhibition as that of
Fig. 2 (solid line) can be constructed at once from the data given
in column four of Table 3. Here the auditory stimulus, when simultaneous
with the tactual, caused 62% reÃ«nforcement, as is indicated
in the figure. The figures in the left-hand margin of the curves indicate
amount of reÃ«nforcement or inhibition in per cent of tactual reaction;
those at the bottom of the curves mark the intervals. On the
curves dots indicate the intervals used in the experiments. Each of
the curves is plotted on the basis of 700 reactions.</p>

<p>In every way comparable with the curves for the males No. 1 and
No. 3 in Fig. 2 are those for the females No. 2 and No. 4 of Fig. 3.
The similarity of the two curves in each figure is noteworthy. Inasmuch
as the conditions of experimentation were the same for all the
animals this would seem to indicate sex-differences which are worthy
of further investigation. The curves show clearly the greater reÃ«nforcement
in the males, and the greater inhibition in the females.</p>

<p>Figures 4 and 5 are the reÃ«nforcement-inhibition curves for the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[Pg 563]</a></span>
series of experiments plotted on the basis of the <em>number</em> of reactions
in excess of half that were reÃ«nforced or inhibited. As there were
fifty pairs of reactions with each frog for each interval, uniform reÃ«nforcement
would be represented by twenty-five reactions above the
base-line; uniform inhibition by twenty-five reactions below the base-line.
The number of reactions is indicated by the figures in the left
margin; the intervals, by those below the base-line. As an illustration
of the application of the method of plotting, the curve for male No. 1
(solid line) of Fig. 4 is constructed from the data of column five of
Table 3. With simultaneous stimuli 17 reactions in excess of half,
<em>i. e.</em>, 17 + 25, or 42, were reÃ«nforced; at .35&#733; interval .5 of a reaction
was the average amount of reÃ«nforcement; at .45&#733; interval 10 reactions
in excess of half, <em>i. e.</em>, 35, were inhibited, therefore the curve falls to
10 below the base-line.</p>

<p>Just as Figures 2 and 3 permit of direct comparison of the results of
the measurement of the <em>amount</em> of reÃ«nforcement and inhibition for
males and females, so Figures 4 and 5 make possible comparison in
similar fashion of the <em>number</em> of reÃ«nforced and inhibited reactions
for the sexes. It is to be noted that the two sets of curves, plotted on
the bases of <em>amount</em> and <em>number</em> of reaction, agree in all important
respects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[Pg 564]</a></span></p>

<p>Figure 6 is the composite curve of amount of reÃ«nforcement-inhibition
for the four animals; Figure 7 is the composite curve of the
number of reactions reÃ«nforced and inhibited.</p>

<p>Summarily stated, the results of the experiments thus far described
are: (1) The auditory stimulus of a quick hammer blow produces the
maximum amount of reÃ«nforcement of tactual reaction when it is
given simultaneously with the tactual stimulus; (2) as the interval
between the auditory and the tactual stimulus approaches .35&#733; the
amount of reÃ«nforcement gradually decreases; (3) when given .35&#733;
before the tactual stimulus the auditory is practically without effect
upon the tactual reaction; (4) as the interval increases above .3&#733;
inhibition begins to appear; (5) the inhibitory influence of the
auditory stimulus is greatest when the interval is about .45&#733;; (6) when
the interval is as long as .90&#733; the auditory stimulus is again ineffective.
It thus appears that the reÃ«nforcement-inhibition curve of this particular
stimulus under the conditions described is representative of a
neural process which completes itself, in passing through two phases,
a positive phase (reÃ«nforcement) and a negative phase (inhibition),
in about one second.</p>

<p><em>b. Prolonged auditory stimulation.</em> The experiments previously
described have proved that a momentary auditory stimulus, which
when given alone never produces a visible motor reaction, either
reÃ«nforces or inhibits the reaction to a tactual stimulus which it
accompanies or precedes. The experiments now to be described were
made for the purpose of ascertaining whether reÃ«nforcement and
inhibition occur in the same way if the auditory stimulus is prolonged,
instead of momentary.</p>

<p>In a trial series of experiments with frog No. 1, one hundred pairs
of reactions were recorded for each of six intervals of auditory stimulation.
The auditory stimulus was given by the ringing of an electric
bell. For all intervals the ringing of the bell continued until the tactual
stimulus was given. When the two stimuli were given simultaneously
the auditory stimulus was necessarily momentary, as in the foregoing
experiments, but for all other relationships of the stimuli the
bell rang for a certain length of time before the tactual stimulus was
given. The six relations of the stimuli were: (1) simultaneous,
(2) bell .2&#733; before and until tactual, (3) bell .6&#733; before, (4) bell 1.05&#733;
before, (5) bell 1.5&#733; before, and (6) bell 2.0&#733; before. The other conditions
of these experiments were the same as those previously described,
except that the auditory stimulus was here given by the opening
of the key which released the pendulum, instead of being given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[Pg 565]</a></span>
by the turning of a key in the course of the pendulum swing. This
method of giving the auditory stimulus as the pendulum was released
was found unsatisfactory because of the irregularity of the magnetic
release; at one time the pendulum would start immediately, at
another time there would be a delay of as much as .1&#733;.</p>

<p>The reÃ«nforcement-inhibition curve plotted on the basis of the
1200 reactions in this series is presented in Fig. 8. Before stopping
to consider the important features of this curve we should note the
results of certain more accurate experiments with prolonged auditory
stimulation.</p>

<p>With two animals, No. 2, a female, and No. 3, a male, fifty pairs of
reactions were taken for nine different intervals (see Table 5) of
auditory stimulation. Each of the curves of Figures 9 and 10 is therefore
based upon 900 reactions. The conditions for these experiments
were the same as those for the momentary stimulation series, save that
the electric bell took the place of the electrically actuated hammer,
as the mechanism for auditory stimulation.</p>

</div>

<p>The important facts exhibited by the results of these prolonged
auditory stimulation experiments in contrast with those with momentary
auditory stimulation are: (1) That whereas for the momentary
auditory stimulus of a hammer blow the reÃ«nforcement is greatest for
simultaneous stimuli, in case of the prolonged stimulation with the
electric bell, reÃ«nforcement increases during an interval of .25&#733; of
auditory stimulation. Hence, the two conditions of stimulation give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[Pg 566]</a></span>
us different types of reÃ«nforcement-inhibition curve. For the momentary
stimulus the maximum reÃ«nforcement appears at simultaneity,
and for the prolonged stimulus at .25&#733;; (2) that the transition
from reÃ«nforcement to inhibition occurs at 1.2&#733; in the prolonged
stimulation curves, while in the momentary stimulation curves it
occurs at .35&#733;; (3) that the maximum inhibition which appears in
the curves under discussion at about 1.5&#733; is less in comparison with
the amount of reÃ«nforcement than that of the momentary stimulation
curves; (4) that the auditory stimulus becomes ineffective when the
interval during which it continues before tactual stimulation is 2.0&#733;.
The curves of Figures 8, 9, and 10 are then representations of a neural
process which passes through a positive and a negative phase in about
2&#733;. The effect of prolongation of the auditory stimulation interval<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[Pg 567]</a></span>
is to lengthen the period of reÃ«nforcement; the period of inhibition
shows little modification.</p>

<p>For the purpose of showing in greater detail the nature of the results
of this work the data from which the curves of Figures 9 and 10 were
constructed are presented in the accompanying Table 5.</p>

<h4>VI. D<span class="smcapa">ISCUSSION</span> <span class="smcapa">OF</span> L<span class="smcapa">ITERATURE</span> <span class="smcapa">AND</span> R<span class="smcapa">ESULTS</span></h4>

<p>The literature on reÃ«nforcement and inhibition is large, and even
that portion of it which deals especially with the importance of the
temporal relations of stimuli in connection with reÃ«nforcement and
inhibition is so extensive that it does not seem worth while to attempt
to give a systematic rÃ©sumÃ© of it for the purposes of this paper. I
shall therefore call attention merely to those investigations which
have contributed directly to the solution of the problems with which
we are now concerned.</p>

<p>Bowditch and Warren<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> discovered that knee-jerk in the human
subject is reÃ«nforced when an auditory, a visual, or a tactual stimulus
precedes the tendon blow by .1&#733; to .5&#733;, whereas the same stimuli have
an inhibitory influence when they are given from .5&#733; to 1.0&#733; before
the tendon blow.</p>

<p>At the suggestion of Bowditch, Cleghorn<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> undertook to investigate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[Pg 569]</a></span>the influence of complication of stimuli upon voluntary movements.
In this research graphic records taken in connection with an ergograph
indicated (1) that "a sensory stimulus" applied just as the
muscle was beginning to contract (voluntarily) caused an increase
in the height of the contraction, and (2) that the relaxation following
a contraction with intercalated sensory stimulus is quicker and more
complete than when no stimulus is given (p. 344). Cleghorn did not
give special attention to the significance of the temporal relations of
the stimuli which he employed, and his work was limited to the
phenomenon of reÃ«nforcement of voluntary action by reason of the
appearance, during the progress of his research, of an excellent paper
on the interference of stimuli by Hofbauer.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>Hofbauer covered thoroughly the ground which Cleghorn had
planned to work over. The ergographic method was employed also
by Hofbauer in his very careful study of the interference of impulses
in the central nervous system of man. It was noticed that while the
subject was rhythmically contracting a certain group of muscles in
response to some prearranged signal (<em>e.g.</em>, the sound of a metronome)
the report of a pistol caused the contraction which immediately followed
it to be much greater than the average of the rhythmic series,
while the next contraction was correspondingly less than the average.
It thus appeared that the sudden sound caused, first, reÃ«nforcement
of the voluntary movement, then, inhibition. The reÃ«nforcement is
greatest, according to Hofbauer, when the voluntary movement
occurs immediately after the pistol report. When the report precedes
the metronome signal by .2&#733; reÃ«nforcement is still marked, but thereafter
it decreases rapidly in amount, until finally at .5&#733; inhibition
appears. When the interval between the two stimuli is 1.0&#733; the first
stimulus has practically no effect upon the voluntary movement in
response to the second. (Hofbauer, p. 558.)</p>

<p>What Bowditch and Warren, not to mention other students of the
subject, have described for reflex action in man, Hofbauer, Cleghorn,
and others have shown to hold true also of voluntary movements.
Unfortunately my own investigation was completed up to the point of
the writing of this paper before I read Hofbauer's work, so I have not
followed methods of dealing with my data which would make our
results directly and easily comparable. But, whatever may be the
relations of our results in detail, there can be no doubt that what he
has demonstrated for man is true in its important aspect of the reÃ«nforcement-inhibition
phenomena for the frog.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[Pg 570]</a></span></p>

<p>Important in their bearings upon the phenomena of reÃ«nforcement
and inhibition which we are now considering, are the various studies
of refractory period and rhythm of nerve cell and fibre. The existence
of a refractory period in neural substance, similar to that demonstrated
for certain kinds of muscle by Marey,<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> Englemann,<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> Kaiser,<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>
Cushny and Matthews,<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> Woodworth,<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> and many others, has been
proved by Broca and Richet.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>Broca and Richet found that in the normal dog the refractory
period of the nerve substance is too short to be easily detectable, they
therefore experimented with animals which were lightly chloralized
and kept at a temperature of 30 to 34&deg; (the mean normal temperature
of the dog is about 39.5&deg;). Under these conditions a dog, when two
identical stimuli (quality and intensity the same) were applied to the
cerebral cortex successively, exhibited the following reactions: (1)
When the stimuli were separated by .01&#733; they reÃ«nforced one another
(addition); (2) when the interval was .1&#733; they inhibited the reaction
partially (subtraction).</p>

<p>Concerning this phenomenon Richet writes in his dictionary of
physiology (p.5): "Marey showed, in 1890, that the heart of the frog,
at certain moments of systole, was inexcitable. Now our experiments
prove that the cerebral apparatus, a certain time after the excitation,
also ceases to be excitable: it then has a refractory phase, and this
refractory phase is much more prolonged than that of the cardiac
muscle." In a later publication Richet<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> makes the somewhat startling
statement that a refractory period is not exhibited by the nerves of
cold-blooded animals. In the tortoise, according to his results, reÃ«nforcement
occurs so long as the interval between the two stimuli is not
greater than 2&#733;, while for longer intervals each stimulus to all appearances
works independently. Richet seems to have generalized from
a study of the tortoise. That his generalization is unwarranted seems
to me highly probable in the light of the results of this paper, for there
are many reasons for supposing that the reÃ«nforcement-inhibition
phenomena with which we have been dealing in case of the frog are
manifestations of the existence of the same process in the nervous
system which under somewhat different conditions of experimentation
exhibits itself in the so-called refractory period.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[Pg 571]</a></span></p>

<p>The researches of Richet and his students indicate that the time
of the process which conditions the phenomena of reÃ«nforcement-inhibition
is about .1&#733;. Stimuli given at .1&#733; intervals do not interfere
with one another. That the process underlying the refractory period
and the reÃ«nforcement-inhibition phenomena of our experiments is
a rhythmic double-phase process is made still more probable by the
following results. Horsley and SchÃ¤fer<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> found that the rate of response
of the monkey to cortical stimulation was 12 per second, and SchÃ¤fer<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>
discovered that the maximum rate of volitional impulses in man is
10 to 12 per second.</p>

<p>It was shown by Exner that certain movements of the foot of a
rabbit could be produced by stimulating either the cortex or the skin
of the foot. Simultaneous stimulation of both regions gives reÃ«nforcement.
Stimulation of the cortex, if given not more than 3&#733; before
subliminal stimulation of the skin, renders the latter effective. When
both stimuli are subliminal each makes the subsequent one effective
if the interval between them is not over 1/8&#733; (SchÃ¤fer<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>). Similarly
for the dog Exner<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> proved that cortical and cutaneous stimuli reÃ«nforced
one another, when both were subliminal, if the interval between
them was not greater than .6&#733;. Cortical and auditory stimuli, and
auditory and cutaneous (of the skin of foot) gave similar results.</p>

<p>Physiologists have long been familiar with several aspects of the
phenomena of reÃ«nforcement and inhibition in the frog, but I know of
no detailed study of the significance of the temporal relations of stimuli
in this connection. Goltz<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> called attention to the inhibition of the
croaking reflex by peripheral stimulation, as well as to several similar
phenomena. Nothnagel,<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> Lewisson,<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> and Wydensky<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> further contributed
to our knowledge of the interference effects of stimuli in the
frog. Wydensky proved that the application of an induced current
to a nerve-muscle preparation may result in either contraction or
relaxation of the muscle, according to the frequency of stimulation.</p>

<p>More recently Merzbacher<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> has dealt with the influences of complication
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[Pg 572]</a></span>of stimuli in the frog with the purpose of ascertaining the
relations of the sense-organs to the reflex movements of the animal.
His first paper is concerned especially with the functional importance
of the eye in connection with reflexes. Unfortunately for the demands
of this research, he did not attend particularly to the temporal relations
of his stimuli. That a visual and a cutaneous stimulus were
given either "at the same time or within a short interval of one
another" (p. 250) is not the sort of information our problems demand.</p>

<p>According to Merzbacher's very interesting results a visual stimulus
reÃ«nforces the reaction to a cutaneous stimulus. As the results of this
paper show, this is only half a truth, for the two stimuli may either
reÃ«nforce or inhibit one another's reactions. As Merzbacher observed
no evidences of reaction to auditory stimulation he presumably did not
attempt to study the influences of the ear in connection with reflexes.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the words reÃ«nforcement and inhibition
as at present used in connection with the functions of the nervous
system cover a multitude of widely differing phenomena. We can at
once distinguish at least two important kinds of reÃ«nforcement or
inhibition: first, that which is due to the functioning of special
augmentary or inhibitory portions of the nervous system; second, that
which is the result of the complication of stimuli. Any and every process
in the nervous system may have either a reÃ«nforcing or an inhibiting
influence upon simultaneous or succeeding processes; doubtless
most processes or impulses at various times have both effects. The
nervous system is constantly being modified by impulses from many
sources, which suppress or strengthen one another according to their
relative intensity, their temporal relations, and the motor relations
of the portions of the organism which they affect.</p>

<p>The existence of the so-called refractory period in brain cortex and
nerve indicates that every stimulus causes certain fundamentally
important changes in the condition of the neural substance. These
changes we may for convenience of illustration describe as modification
of excitability, or of the functional capacity of central or peripheral
tissues. Every stimulus causes a portion of the neural substance to
pass from its normal state through a condition of increased excitability,
which we may designate the positive phase, to a condition of
diminished excitability, the negative phase. There is first an increase
in the functional capacity of the tissues, then a decrease. If during the
course of the change produced by a given stimulus a second stimulus
becomes effective its result in reaction is determined by the particular
phase of the tissues upon which it intrudes. If the nervous system is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[Pg 573]</a></span>
in the condition of increased excitability, and the two stimuli act upon
sensory regions whose motor connections are not antagonistic, the
reaction will be reÃ«nforced, as we say, by the previous stimulus; if,
however, the second stimulus falls upon the negative phase of the
nerve substance, the reaction will be partially or totally inhibited.</p>

<p>The facts which are most prominent as the result of this investigation
are, first, that the temporal relation of stimuli is an important
condition of certain forms of reÃ«nforcement and inhibition; second,
that the interference effects of two stimuli cannot be studied to
advantage without attention to the relations of the forms of reaction
which are appropriate to each stimulus.</p>


<h4>V. S<span class="smcapa">UMMARY</span></h4>

<p>1. Motor reactions of the green frog to electric stimuli are inhibited
either partially or wholly by photic stimuli. The visual stimulus of a
moving object has a like effect. It has been found, furthermore, that
the same visual stimulus may either inhibit or reÃ«nforce the motor
reaction in response to electric stimulation. When the two stimuli are
given simultaneously reÃ«nforcement occurs, when the visual stimulus
precedes the electric by half a second or more inhibition appears.</p>

<p>2. An auditory stimulus, which does not produce any visible reaction
when given alone, modifies respiration and the reactions to other
stimuli when given in connection with them.</p>

<p>3. The momentary auditory stimulus of a quick hammer blow
when simultaneous with tactual stimulation reÃ«nforces the reaction
to the latter stimulus. This reÃ«nforcement, or increase in the amount
of reaction, ranges from 50 to 100% of the average reaction to the
tactual stimulus alone. When the auditory stimulus is given before
the tactual reÃ«nforcement occurs in gradually decreasing amount until
the interval between the two stimuli reaches .35&#733;; at this point the
auditory stimulus has no apparent effect upon the tactual reaction.
As the interval is still further increased inhibition appears and continues
for intervals between .35&#733; and .9&#733;. ReÃ«nforcement is greatest
when the two stimuli are simultaneous; inhibition is greatest when
the momentary auditory stimulus precedes the tactual by .4&#733; to .6&#733;.
When the interval reaches .9&#733; the first stimulus does not affect the
reaction to the second.</p>

<p>4. ReÃ«nforcement is greater for the males than for the females;
inhibition appears sooner and lasts longer in case of the females.
This apparently indicates that the males are stimulated to activity by
certain auditory stimuli, whereas the females are rendered passive
by similar sounds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[Pg 574]</a></span></p>

<p>5. Prolonged auditory stimulation by means of an electric bell
causes reÃ«nforcement and inhibition, according to the temporal relations
of the stimuli, as does momentary auditory stimulation, with
the following differences: The maximum reÃ«nforcement occurs when
the tactual stimulus is given about .25&#733; after auditory stimulation has
begun; reÃ«nforcement continues for a period of 1.2&#733;, <em>i. e.</em>, when the
electric bell continues to ring until the tactual stimulus is given, it
reÃ«nforces the tactual reaction from simultaneity to 1.2&#733;. Inhibition
then appears, and continues until 1.8&#733;. Both momentary and prolonged
auditory stimulation cause first reÃ«nforcement, then inhibition
of the appropriate reaction to a tactual stimulus.</p>

<p>6. The reÃ«nforcement-inhibition curves for the frog are very similar
to those for man.</p>

<p>7. In case of the several pairs of stimuli whose interference effects
have been studied reÃ«nforcement-inhibition appears. The first stimulus
reÃ«nforces reaction to the second so long as the interval between
them is not more than about .4&#733;, while it inhibits the reaction when
the interval is longer. Whether this reÃ«nforcement-inhibition curve
as given in the experiments described may similarly be obtained for
any and every pair of stimuli, no matter what their relation to reactions,
remains to be determined.</p>

<p>8. In connection with the study of the mutual relations of stimuli
of which this paper gives an account certain facts concerning the sense
of hearing have been discovered. A summary statement of the results
on hearing may be found on page 551.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_TEMPORAL_RELATIONS_OF" id="THE_TEMPORAL_RELATIONS_OF"></a>THE TEMPORAL RELATIONS OF
NEURAL PROCESSES</h2>

<p class="p1b">BY ROBERT M. YERKES</p>


<p>Muscle contraction-time, according to the determinations of several
investigators, varies about .0035&#733;.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> Sanderson states that the time for
direct stimulation of the muscle is approximately .0035&#733; and for indirect
stimulation, by means of the nerve, .007&#733;. The rate of nerve-transmission
in the frog ranges from 25 to 35 metres per second.</p>

<p>Reflex reaction-time, as might be expected, varies widely with the
nature of the reaction elicited by a stimulus, the condition of the animal,
and the quality and strength of the stimulus. For many of the
simple motor reactions of the frog it ranges between 20 and 60<sup>&#963;</sup>.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>
Whether reflex reaction-time is to be sharply contrasted with instinctive
and voluntary reaction-times, or whether they indistinguishably
merge into one another is a question of considerable interest and importance
for the student of the evolution of activity.</p>

<p>Voluntary reaction-time may be as short as 150<sup>&#963;</sup> or as long as life,
in an animal capable of profiting by experience as does the frog. It is
preÃ«minently the delayed type of reaction-time.</p>

<p>So much concerning the temporal relations of neural processes in
the frog being well established, the purpose of the present paper is to
call attention to some experimental results which indicate the existence
of clearly defined types of reaction, and suggest possible values of
reaction-time as a sign of mind.</p>

<p>The specific problems to be considered are: (1) Do reaction-times,
in any given animal, range with equal frequency of occurrence from
short to long, or are there certain modes (most frequented classes)
which indicate definite types of reaction, such, for example, as the reflex,
instinctive, etc.? (2) If there is distribution of the reaction-times
about one or more modes, what are the types of reaction indicated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[Pg 576]</a></span>
thereby? (3) Finally, is reaction-time of service as a sign or measure
of consciousness?</p>

<p>I wish especially to call attention to the fact that this paper deals
with the reactions of the frog, not with animal reactions in general.</p>

<p>Two years ago in connection with a discussion of the reaction-time
of the green frog to electrical and tactual stimuli,<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> I presented a curve
showing the distribution of 277 reaction-times to an electrical stimulus.
The curve exhibited two clearly defined modes: one at between 60 and
70<sup>&#963;</sup> and the other at about 160<sup>&#963;</sup>. There was further a group of delayed
reactions ranging about 500<sup>&#963;</sup>. This form of distribution was interpreted,
at the time, as indicative of three types of reaction, called,
respectively, the reflex, the instinctive, and the delayed.</p>

<p>I have since obtained and examined with reference to form of distribution
the further data which are presented in this paper. The reactions
are all those of the green frog to electrical stimulation. The stimulus
was applied by means of wires on the reaction-board on which the
frog rested during the experiments. When reaction occurred in response
to the electrical stimulus a circuit through the time-measuring
apparatus was broken by the release of a delicate spring which had
been held in place up to the instant of reaction by the weight of the
frog. A Hipp chronoscope, controlled by a Cattell falling screen,
served as a time-measuring mechanism. Three intensities of stimulus
were used: (1) A current from one Mesco dry cell, (2) from two cells,
and (3) from four cells.</p>

<p>Of the reactions whose time was measured there are three series.
Series I is constituted by the recorded reaction-times in response to
a one-cell stimulus, Series II, those in response to a two-cell stimulus,
and Series III, those in response to a four-cell stimulus. The number
of reactions, range and mode of each series are as follows:</p>

<p>The distribution of the 481 reaction-times of Series I and II is
shown by Figure 1; that of the 256 reaction-times of Series III, by
Figure 2. For both of these distribution polygons the reaction-times
were arranged in ten<sup>&#963;</sup> classes, beginning with the class 41-50<sup>&#963;</sup><a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[Pg 577]</a></span>case of the combined Series I and II and with the class 61-70<sup>&#963;</sup> in the
case of Series III.</p>

<p>Series I exhibits a primary mode at 235<sup>&#963;</sup>. There are no reflex reactions
in this series, unless it be maintained that the reflex reactions
of the frog may have a reaction-time of over 160<sup>&#963;</sup>, but there are a number
of delayed reactions, some of which have reaction-times as long as
798<sup>&#963;</sup>. This intensity of stimulation (one cell) may be said to call forth
prompt reactions, which we may provisionally call instinctive, and
delayed reactions, which have all the appearances of voluntary acts.
There are no reactions which come within the range commonly considered
as the reflex range of the frog (20-60<sup>&#963;</sup>), and there are relatively
few delayed reactions: almost all centre about the mode 235<sup>&#963;</sup>.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img  src="images/i_577.jpg" alt="Graph" />
</div>

<p>Series II, in contrast with Series I, exhibits a secondary mode at 65<sup>&#963;</sup>
in addition to the primary mode at 235<sup>&#963;</sup>. The stimulus-intensity of
this series (roughly twice as great as that for Series I) induces a variety
of short reaction, which did not appear in the case of the one-cell stimulus,
and at the same time fewer delayed reactions. The range of the
reaction-times for the two series is about the same, but the lower limits
are markedly different.</p>

<p>Observation of the subjects during the experiments revealed two
methods of reaction to the two-cell stimulus: a locomotor reaction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[Pg 578]</a></span>
(jump) which at once removed the animal from the source of stimulation,
and a twitch of the hind legs which was instantly followed by the
above-mentioned locomotor reaction. The leg reactions constitute the
reflex group of Fig. 1, the usual prompt locomotor reactions, the instinctive
group, and the slow locomotor reactions, the delayed or voluntary
group.</p>

<p>It is to be noted that the instinctive reaction-time mode is the same
for the two intensities of stimulation. This apparently indicates that
change in intensity of stimulation causes a change in the type of reaction,
not merely a gradual change in the position of the mode. For
example, the modal reaction-time of 235<sup>&#963;</sup> given by a one-cell stimulus
did not shift to 200<sup>&#963;</sup> or lower, as might have been expected, but instead
there appeared a new type of reaction. The average reaction-times for
the two series indicate a decrease in time with increase in intensity of
stimulation, but they give no indication of the really important difference
in the two series of reactions. The great importance of the distribution
of the data, in addition to the common statistical quantities, is
manifest.</p>

<p>Series III, whose reactions occurred in response to a very strong stimulus,
differs in several important respects from the other series. Its
range is much narrower, only 117<sup>&#963;</sup>. Delayed reactions are lacking,
and so also, curiously enough, are the reflex reactions of Series II.
Instead of either or both of the modes of Series II, there appears in
Series III an intermediate mode at 105<sup>&#963;</sup>.</p>

<p>Our interpretation of these facts is facilitated by results of observation
of the reacting subject. The leg reflex which frequently occurred
in response to the two-cell stimulus never appeared in response to the
four-cell stimulus. This in part explains the lack of the short reaction-time
mode of Series II; it does not, however, account for the lack of
delayed reactions. The latter fact may be referred to the intensity of
the stimulus. Another difficulty in interpretation appears in connection
with the intermediate mode, 105<sup>&#963;</sup>. Is this to be considered an instinctive
mode, as were those at 235<sup>&#963;</sup>, or a reflex mode? Where is the
line between reflex and instinctive action to be drawn? These results
very clearly indicate that no line can be drawn, except quite arbitrarily.
Reflex reaction-time, in the case of the frog, is continuous with
instinctive, yet for any given situation the reflex, instinctive, and delayed
(voluntary?) modes are likely to appear, as, for example, in the
case of the data of this paper. Our conclusion must be, therefore, that
although types of reaction are indicated by reaction-time results, the
mode for a given type varies too much in position with different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[Pg 579]</a></span>
conditions to make it possible to say that a particular reaction-time
is that of a certain type.</p>

<p>We may safely say, then, that for any given subject, the muscle contraction-time,
nerve transmission-time, and simple sensory reaction-time
to the constant stimulus in question being known, we should be
able safely to interpret reaction-time records in terms of reaction types.
For reflex, instinctive, and voluntary are terms which designate modes
of reaction, albeit not isolated classes, for they intergrade.</p>

<p>Whether there are more types of reaction than are indicated by the
data of this report does not concern us at present, for the practical as
well as the theoretical bearings of our conclusions depend upon the
existence of types, and not upon their number.</p>

<p>Hesitation in reaction is commonly accepted as an important sign
of volitional consciousness in man; consequently delayed reactions in
lower animals are supposed to be indicative of psychic processes.
Granting this much, reaction-time may be used as a sign of consciousness.
It cannot be denied that the longer the reaction-time of a given
animal the greater the probability that the reaction is conditioned by
mental processes. Such a statement, it is true, has a basis neither
better nor worse than that of most of our inferences concerning the
nature of the actions of our fellow beings. As I have already attempted
to show in a discussion of criteria of consciousness in animal psychology,<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>
there is no one criterion of consciousness which can be used
alone satisfactorily, but instead there are numerous signs of mind each
of which has value according to the number and variety of our observations
concerning its occurrence in connection with states of consciousness.
The more of such signs we discover and learn to evaluate
properly in relation to consciousness in its different grades and to
one another, the safer will be our inferences concerning the existence
of mental processes in animals.</p>

<p>Reaction-time is presented in this paper as an additional sign of
mind. Like all other signs it is of value only if used as one of a series
of indications of mental life. For if we attempt to judge of consciousness
by reference to reaction-time alone, we may be seriously misled,
whereas if we use it in connection with docility, variability, neural specialization,
and other recognizedly valuable signs, we may be greatly
aided in our inference. As in juristic procedure judgment is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[Pg 580]</a></span>
based upon one bit of evidence nor even upon the evidence of a single
witness, but upon evidence accumulated from all available sources, so
in our attempts to judge of the existence of consciousness, it matters
not whether the being be human or infra-human, we should make
use of all phenomena which are recognized as signs of mind. The
chief task of comparative psychology at present is the discovery and
evaluation of signs of mind.</p>

<p>Reaction-time data, however, furnish another sign, or, as I prefer
to call it in this case, measure of the intensity of consciousness; for
variability of the time of reaction as well as its duration is significant.
Reflex reaction-time is relatively constant, instinctive varies considerably,
and the variability of voluntary reaction-time is extremely large.
Degree of variability of reaction-time may be used as an indication
of consciousness in the same way that variability in the form of reaction
is used. The higher the power of consciousness the greater the
variety in form of reaction and the variability of the reaction-time.</p>

<p>Reaction-time studies, as well as introspection and the investigation
of animal behavior, indicate the importance of three activity concepts:
automatism, instinct, and will. The automatic act is quick and
relatively constant in form as well as reaction-time, while all signs
lead us to infer that consciousness, when it accompanies the act, is a
sequent phenomenon and not a condition of the act. The instinctive
act is both slower and more variable in form and time than the automatic:
consciousness is indicated as an accompaniment, and apparently
it is at times a condition of the act. The will-act is extremely
variable, unique in form, and almost without limits of reaction-time,
for the conscious organism may react to the present situation in a fifth
of a second, a day, or a year. Will is experience in action: it is our
name for individually acquired control, and voluntary action is above
all consciously conditioned activity.</p>

<p>Reaction-time, with respect to its two aspects of duration and variability,
may be used as a sign or criterion of consciousness, for in accordance
with the nature of these two sets of facts we classify acts as
reflex, instinctive, or voluntary.</p>

<p class="p1b">AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF CERTAIN EMOTIONAL AND
ASSOCIATIVE PROCESSES</p>

<p class="p1b">BY JOHN E. ROUSE</p>


<h4>I. I<span class="smcapa">NTRODUCTION</span></h4>

<p>Naturalists have observed the habits of pigeons, and physiologists
since Flourens have subjected them to numerous experiments, but so
far they seem to have received little psychological study. As a contribution
to this interesting field the present paper reports an investigation
of certain emotional and associative processes of the domestic
pigeon. Since the literature of the subject is meagre, I shall state at the
beginning a few related facts which I have gathered from various
sources; then I shall discuss in detail the problems, methods, and
results of my several experiments.</p>

<p>The brain of the pigeon is well developed, although the hemispheres
are unconvoluted. When they are removed, the animal retains unaltered
its reflex and vital activities, but ceases for a time at least to
show evidence of mental life, for example, memory and will.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> In the
normal animal sight and hearing are acute, and touch seems keen,
although the claws are not used for grasping and eating, as in the case
of more intelligent birds, especially, parrots. There is considerable
sensitiveness to temperature changes. Taste, and probably smell,
appear to be deficient.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> The "sense of support" is marked, even in
the young.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>Since the pigeon seems to dream and also to miss its absent mate,
some observers believe that imagery is present. There is certainly
local memory, and also capacity to observe. Various intelligent acts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[Pg 582]</a></span>have been reported.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> The remarkable homing habits of the carrier
pigeon have received no satisfactory explanation. While Cyon<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> suggests
the stimulation of the nasal organs by air currents, ThauziÃ¨r<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>
holds to the electrical theory; they agree, however, that certain higher
psychical processes are probably involved.</p>

<p>Graber's<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> tests indicate that pigeons have no color-preference.
Beebe's<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> statement concerning birds in general is peculiarly true
of pigeons: "There are few species which do not show the emotions
of love and sympathy, and ... one will sometimes pine and die of
grief at the loss of its mate." After referring to their patient care
of the young, he adds: "Indeed, sympathy is the keynote in the development
of the higher mental faculties." These birds communicate,
but their language consists of comparatively few sounds. As in many
other birds, the play-instinct is highly developed.</p>


<h4>II. P<span class="smcapa">ROBLEMS</span> <span class="smcapa">AND</span> M<span class="smcapa">ETHODS</span></h4>

<p>My study of the pigeon's <em>emotional life</em> had for its object certain
respiratory "expressions." These were investigated by means of a
pneumographic tracing, secured while the animal was comfortably
fastened in a shallow nest, partially open below. A small box was
placed over the bird, and apparatus was so arranged that the time
of giving various stimuli was recorded automatically on the smoked
paper of the kymograph drum, below the breathing-curve. A third
line indicated rate of drum movement. Although some interesting
results were obtained, the chief significance of the research consists in
its demonstration of the fact that this method of studying animal mind
is valuable.</p>

<p>In the study of <em>association</em> I sought to determine the sense-data
which the process involves, its method of formation (with due regard
to social conditions), its rapidity, permanence, and modifiability, and
also its probable degree of complexity. Material contributing to
the subject was secured by observing the behavior of the animal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[Pg 583]</a></span>
when seeking to obtain food by overcoming such obstacles as labyrinths
with wire passages, and latches, when the food was left in view,
or by finding it when out of sight. In the latter case it was placed in
a box occupying a customary place in a group of exactly similar
boxes, or else in a box of color or form unlike the other members of the
group and variously arranged, from time to time, with respect to them.
When the animals were learning the labyrinth habits, various stimulations
were given them; later the character of some of these was
altered, and the resulting changes in behavior were noted. After
the habits had been thoroughly learned, the birds were given a rest
for some weeks, and then tested again under the old conditions. A
few trials were arranged with special reference to the study of imitation;
the animals here were tested as to their ability to execute simple
but unfamiliar acts, after having only seen them performed by an
animal previously trained. Throughout the associational tests the
animals very seldom received food in their cages; but as they were
tested daily and allowed to satisfy their hunger completely at the last
test, they were never in a state of "utter hunger"&mdash;a condition which
most experimenters think best to avoid. A series of tests, given at the
conclusion of the investigation, indicated that the odor of the food had
not assisted the animals in reaching it.</p>

<p>In the two series of experiments (emotion and association) thirty-five
animals in all were used. They were confined in large cages in a
fairly well lighted and ventilated room, and were fed wheat, cracked
corn, and occasionally fruit, and kept well supplied with fresh water
and sand. They generally remained in a healthy condition throughout
the tests, especially during the winter. To exclude, as far as possible,
the disturbing influence of fear, they were usually handled only after
the room had been darkened. As the noise made by the curtains was
objectionable, the birds were tested with the room illuminated by
incandescent lamps; the light was turned off before the birds were
placed in position for the trials, and again before they were removed
from the apparatus to the cages. It is generally agreed that an experimenter
should be out of sight when giving a test. I am convinced that
it is important to avoid being seen by the animals at any time. This
involves great inconvenience, especially when one employs the pneumographic
method, but better results are thus obtained.</p>

<p>For practical suggestions as to apparatus and methods I am greatly
indebted to Dr. Robert MacDougall, at the beginning of my investigation,
and to Dr. Robert M. Yerkes, throughout. I also owe much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[Pg 584]</a></span>

<p>1. <em>Respiration in general.</em> The normal breathing-curve in pigeons
is quite similar in contour to that of the human subject, although
the rhythm is more rapid and the pauses are less pronounced. When
acoustical, visual, olfactory, or tactual stimuli are given, various
modifications appear, for example, quickening, deepening, and minor
irregularities. It was noticed that meaningless stimuli (pistol-shots)
quickly lose their disturbing influence, whereas the breathing remains
sensitive to those of a significant character, such as the noises made
by other birds. It was also found that a stimulus which no longer
affects the breathing will sometimes occasion disturbance if accompanied
by a second stimulus of another order, although of a weak
intensity (summation).</p>

<p>2. <em>Respiratory reactions to light.</em> As the easy control of conditions
makes vision an excellent field in which to work, light reactions were
investigated in detail. Two distinct series of tests were given. One
sought to determine the relation between quality of light and reaction;
the other, between intensity of light and reaction. Four colors of one
intensity and three intensities of one color, respectively, were used.
In the first series four stimuli, one for each of the colors, red, yellow,
green, and blue, were given daily; in the second series five daily stimuli
were given, of the same intensity for any one day, and one minute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[Pg 585]</a></span>
apart; this made it possible to observe also the effect of repetition.
Each stimulus was given at the beginning of a respiration and continued
two seconds. When the tracings were studied, various modifications
were noted, but special attention was paid to alterations in
rate of breathing. In the case of both sets of trials an immediate
quickening usually occurred after stimulation, and occasionally
shallowing<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> and minor irregularities of contour.</p>

<p>In the first set of tests ten animals were used for twenty-five days.
Average results indicated that red and yellow are less stimulating than
green and blue. To secure data that would assist in the interpretation
of these results, an investigation was made of the animals' color-preference.
This was done by recording, at thirty-minute intervals,
the position of the birds when confined, singly, in a box one half of
which was illuminated (from the side) by light of one color, and one
half by light of different color but of the same intensity. A water
screen excluded the heat rays. After nine records had been taken the
colored glasses were interchanged, and the animal's position relatively
to the two colors was observed as before. This was repeated with the
other colors until each of the four had been used with each of the
other three. There were far more choices of green and blue than of
red and yellow, though none of the colors was avoided. It seemed
a question of <em>degree of liking</em>, rather than of liking or disliking. As
stated, Graber's experiments indicated that pigeons have no color-preference,
but his results are probably untrustworthy, since he tested
several animals at once and apparently was not careful to change the
colored glasses regularly. Putting together our two sets of data (the
latter stated first) we have the following comparison:</p>

</table></div>

<p>Although the proportions do not hold, there is a direct correspondence
between the two series of responses; hence it would seem that
<em>increased respiratory activity is an expression of agreeable feeling</em> in
pigeons, and this especially since the breathing, when varying at all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[Pg 586]</a></span>
in amplitude, usually became shallower, and also showed certain minor
irregularities of contour, as often occurs in human respiration during
moderate stimulation of a pleasant character.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p>In the second series of respiratory tests four animals were used for
fifteen days. Average results showed nothing as to the relation between
intensity of stimulus and amount of quickening, since the three
intensities used, 1, 2, and 4, produced reactions, respectively, as
follows: 6.6%, 4.3%, and 6.4%. This may have been because the
three intensities were employed each on different days. When the
reactions are averaged according to daily succession, without regard
to the intensities of the stimuli, we get the following results: first
reaction, 8.0% rise in rate; second, 3.7%; third, 4.1%; fourth,
5.7%; and fifth, 6.9%. We should have expected the second daily
response to be less vigorous than the first, since the animals were
perhaps better prepared for the second stimulation. That the reactions
increased thereafter was probably due, partially to summation,
and partially to the fact that the short illuminations occasioned mental
action (<em>perception</em> of interior of box, increased <em>desire</em> to escape, etc.)
which involved heightened, rather than depressed, breathing activity,
and thus worked directly against the dulling tendency of repetition.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>


<h4>IV. I<span class="smcapa">NVESTIGATION</span> <span class="smcapa">OF</span> A<span class="smcapa">SSOCIATION</span></h4>

<p>1. <em>Labyrinth experiments.</em> Four labyrinths in all were used
(L, M, H, O). Each was constructed by attaching moveable wire
partitions in a wooden box, covered with chicken wire. The pigeon
was admitted through a small entrance compartment which was
fastened at one end of the box, and which communicated with it by
means of a lifting door, operated by pulling a cord from behind the
observation curtain. Food was placed within the maze, and usually
at the opposite end. Before beginning the tests the bird was allowed to
become thoroughly familiar with the box without the partitions. After
a few trials it learned to go to the food immediately upon entering
the box. The partitions were then put into position, and the bird was
tested as to the time required (except in the case of labyrinth O) and
as to the method employed in reaching the food. The time was measured
by means of a stop-watch, and the bird's horizontal movements
were recorded on a small plot of the labyrinth; other general observations
were added.</p>

<div class="caption"><blockquote><p class="left">F<span class="smcapa">IG</span>. 1. Labyrinth L. BB, box 6 in. high; E, entrance; F, feeding-place;

the apparatus.</p></blockquote></div>
</div>

<p>In this labyrinth (Fig. 1) six animals were tested once daily for
thirty days, and five of these again after two and six weeks, respectively.
On entering the labyrinth with the partitions in place the first
time, a bird started on its usual direct course toward the food-box;
running against the first partition it made vigorous efforts to push
through, flying at the wire and often clinging to it for a short time;
some of these random movements eventually brought it to the left
of the compartment, and thence, through the opening, into the second
compartment, and so on through the others, until finally it reached
the food by a series of fortunate accidents.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> The same general reaction
was shown in case of the next few tests, except that fewer and fewer
useless movements were made, and that the right ones were carried
out with greater and greater precision. Later the animal had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[Pg 588]</a></span>
difficulty in reaching the food; it did not run against the partitions,
enter the blind alley, nor display such general signs of uncertainty as
pausing and looking about. The process of learning in this case was
obviously one of "trial and error," or the selection of useful movements.
From the mass of random movements constituting the reaction
to the unfamiliar environment, only those which enabled the bird
to reach the food were retained and improved; the others gradually
disappeared until finally the path taken became the shortest one
possible, and was entered upon and pursued without hesitation by
each animal as soon as it was allowed to enter the labyrinth. The
time required for the tests is given in Table I.</p>

<p>It will be seen at a glance that the absolute time required for
reaching the food varied for the individuals (see especially the results
given by different birds in the case of test 1), but that the several
periods for any one bird were relatively similar to those for another;
and also that the time was long at first, but rapidly shortened from
test to test, thus showing a steady advance in the learning process.
Various lapses occurred (for example, A, 8; C, 13; E, 10) after the
habit had been fairly well fixed.</p>

<p>In tests 18-22 the time-shortening was due principally to quickening
of movements which had already become well defined. The great importance
of visual data is brought out by the abrupt lengthening of the
periods in the case of tests 23-25, and 26-30, where the light intensities
were decreased. The lengthening was roughly proportional to the
change of illumination. In the relative darkness the birds had to re-acquire
the habits. The same mistakes were made as at first (running
against partitions, and into the blind alley), yet here, as before,
there was a ready adjustment. That the food was out of sight, or at
least very much less visible, probably made no difference, since it was
found that the birds would readily go to the old place after both food
and food-box had been removed. In order to exclude the light entirely
without making their movements invisible to me, I blindfolded the
birds by means of a thin black hood, comfortably adjusted over their
eyes and top of head; as a result, none was able to make the course
in twenty minutes. The first turn, however, was usually made naturally,
perhaps because associated with certain non-visual sense-data
(sound of the lifting door, and perhaps tactual impressions of the close
entrance compartment, etc.). Rats<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> seem far less dependent upon
visual data than do pigeons. The great permanence of the pigeons'
habits is shown by comparing the periods for tests 31-3, given after
two and six weeks of rest, respectively, with those for tests 18-22.</p>

<p>Let us now notice the gradual progress of learning in three important
parts of the maze, as shown in Fig. 2. It will be seen that in the
beginning the animals started upon their usual course and pressed
against the first partition (stage 1), but that later they touched it less
and less (stages 2 and 3), and that finally they avoided it entirely (stage
4). The adjustment here was fairly simple: the sound made by the
opening of the entrance door, and the glimpse thus given of the labyrinth,
gradually came to be conditions of the movements of turning to
the left, on emerging from the entrance, and passing along the compartment
toward the opening, where impressions, mostly visual, in the
same manner determined the movements of turning to the right and
entering compartment 2.</p>

<p>The blind alley was naturally a decided obstacle. The pigeons
learned to avoid this compartment by going around it only after many
unsuccessful attempts to go through it. During the first test the animals
entered it many times (stage 1); on emerging they returned to
the second or the first compartment, only to encounter the pen again
when they re-advanced toward the food; finally, on reÃ«merging from
the annoying enclosure, perhaps for the eighth or tenth time, they
might happen to turn to the right instead of going forward as usual
toward the entrance of the box, and thus make their way along the
new passage and reach the food. For the next few tests they usually
entered the blind alley, but less frequently, and they remained for
shorter periods (stages 2-4). Later they merely entered (stage 5); and
still later they passed very near the opening without entering, or only
paused a moment before it (stage 6); and finally they passed it without
the slightest hesitation, walking briskly, but with well-directed
movements, midway between the partitions (stages 7-8). The act of
turning seemed to be an especially important factor in this habit. We
notice that it was a turn to the right (most probably accidental) which
first enabled the animals to get beyond the opening of the blind alley;
that this same act was repeated in each successive trial until, by the
gradual shortening of the loop forming the path taken by the animals
in passing into, and from, the labyrinth it was finally reduced to a mere
pause (stage 6); and that this later disappeared entirely, leaving
only the left turn, which instead was now conditioned by the visual
data at that part of the labyrinth and carried the animal past the
entrance of the blind alley.</p>

</div>

<p>The animals did not come in contact with the second partition until
they had almost learned to pass the opening of the blind alley (see
stage 6). This was probably because the turn to the left which was made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[Pg 592]</a></span>
on approaching <em>x</em> was associated with visual data derived from
points farther along the course (<em>y</em>), and when the animals reached
<em>z</em>, compartment 2, these same data were received and were sufficient
to occasion the turn to the left there also, thus bringing the birds
against the partition. The adjustment
was made principally
on the basis of new sense-data
arising from running against the
wire, looking at it more closely,
etc. For a few trials the birds
made the turn at <em>x</em> too quickly,
and thus failed to reach the third
compartment. One of my most
intelligent subjects made this
mistake in the third test, and
again in the sixth and seventh,
and retained the act almost unchanged
through the tenth,
eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth,
fourteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth,
twentieth, and twenty-first
tests, so strong was the tendency
to continue a movement
once begun, though it was really
disadvantageous.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p>Although this maze was much more difficult, it will be seen that the
animals learned the route to the food far more readily than before.
The first period in this series was only about one fourth as long as the
first period in the other, and the course was mastered sooner (by the
fifth trial instead of by the ninth). There was less pressing against
the wire than before, and unsuccessful movements were sooner discontinued.
This improvement was probably due entirely to experience
gained in dealing with the first maze. Thorndike speaks of the
gradually increasing ability of animals to deal with successive contrivances.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>

<p class="p2b">C. <em>Habits in Labyrinth H</em></p>

<p>Since hearing is an important sense in pigeons, we should expect
them to be capable of useful acoustical associations. Several things
occurred in the course of the two preceding experiments which seemed
to indicate that this is true; for example, although I could move
about, rather noisily, in the darkened room, without apparently disturbing
any of the birds, some few showed signs of fright (moving
about restlessly) on hearing the low, grating noises made by lifting
the hanging door of the cage, sounds which had always preceded the
handling of the subjects before experimentation, and which had probably
become signs to them of being taken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[Pg 594]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption"><blockquote><p class="left">F<span class="smcapa">IG</span>. 4. Learning-curves: A, in Labyrinth L; B, in Labyrinth M. Divisions

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[Pg 595]</a></span></p>

<p>To investigate this kind of association I constructed a labyrinth
(see Fig. 5) in connection with which sounds could be utilized as one
form of sense-data. The passages were so arranged that along the
route leading to the food there were three blind alleys, which the animals
would surely enter before mastering the course. In another part
of the room were placed, very close to each other, two electric gongs
of the same size, but of different material. One was of metal and gave
a clear ringing sound; the other was of wood and gave a low rattling
noise.</p>

<p>When an animal was learning the route (as in the other two mazes)
I sounded the gongs, the metallic, as the bird approached and entered
the blind alleys, by openings <em>M</em>, <em>O</em>, and <em>R</em>, and the wooden, as it
emerged from them and proceeded along the proper course, and
occasionally after it had reached the food. The ringing sound was
also given after the animal passed <em>P</em> and was approaching <em>Q</em>. When
the new route was fairly well learned, I changed the order of the sound
stimuli, ringing one gong at the places where the other had previously
been sounded, and compared the records thus obtained with those
obtained when the sounds were given in the original order. As an
animal is liable to become confused by the sounds, or else quickly
accustomed to them, I thought it best to give only a few trials, one
trial with the usual order of sound stimulations, the next immediately
following with the reversed order, and so on till four pairs of records
had been secured, the series of trials being completed in a single day.
Four animals were thus tested. The periods of the various trials are
shown in Table III.</p>

<p>In the case of thirteen of the sixteen tests given with reversed
acoustical conditions (see column II) the periods were longer than
the corresponding ones given alternately with them for comparison,
and there was an average time-lengthening of 5.2 seconds per trial, or
34.2%. The following is a short description of the animals' reactions
to the changed conditions. It corresponds to the time-values expressed
in column II of the table.</p>

<p>Bird A: test 1, animal undisturbed; test 2, drew back from <em>S</em>,
turned to the left and went toward <em>R</em>, but later returned and passed
<em>S</em> without pausing; test 3, paused at <em>O</em> for a short interval, but did
not enter the blind alley; test 4, paused at <em>O</em> again, later drew back
from <em>S</em>, turned to the left and entered blind alley 3; it soon escaped,
and this time passed <em>S</em> without being disturbed, although it paused
at <em>T</em> and <em>U</em>.</p>

<p>Bird B: tests 1 and 2, animal apparently undisturbed; test 3, a few
slight pauses at openings; test 4, drew back from <em>S</em>, entered blind
alley 3, but soon escaped and passed <em>S</em> without hesitation.</p>

<p>Bird E: test 1, undisturbed; tests 2 and 4, paused at openings;
test 3, turned back from <em>S</em>, entered blind alley 3, and paused at several
places later when passing toward F.</p>

<p>Bird G: test 1, many pauses; test 2, turned from <em>S</em> and entered
blind alley 3; test 3, undisturbed; test 4, drew back from <em>S</em>, went
toward <em>R</em>, but did not enter the blind alley.</p>

<p>As the animals gave little attention to the wooden gong, but were
always sensitive to the metallic one, their observed movements probably
must be accounted for chiefly on the basis of certain visual and
organic sense-data <em>now with</em>, and <em>now without</em>, the ringing sound.
The data governing the start (as already noticed) were probably sufficient
for the avoidance of the first blind alley when the gongs were
reversed. In case of the other two, however, the birds had come
to depend upon acoustical data, and when these were lacking as they
approached the openings <em>O</em> and <em>Q</em>, the left turn could not readily
be initiated, hence certain hesitations and misdirections of movement
frequently occurred. Experience with the blind alley in the
first experiment assisted the animals in dealing with the second blind
alley here, but mistakes were made. Visual data usually were sufficient
to produce the proper turn at <em>Q</em>, but when the ringing sound
was given just afterwards, it sometimes occasioned the left turn, thus
bringing the animals toward the opening of the blind alley. While
the tests given were not such as would indicate how far pigeons can
discriminate sounds, they certainly show that these birds are capable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[Pg 597]</a></span>
of useful sound associations, although visual ones are evidently of
greater importance to them.</p>


<p class="p2b">D. <em>Habits in Labyrinth O</em></p>

<p>I next made tests in which tactual and electrical sense-data could
also be utilized. In one of the passages of a simple labyrinth was
placed a board 8 in. square and 3/4 in. thick, over which were stretched
copper wires which formed a series of interrupted electrical circuits.
By closing a key a bird could
be stimulated whenever it
stepped upon the wire surface.
A second key was
connected with a metallic
gong. When an animal on
its way through the maze
first stepped upon the wire
surface, electrical and acoustical
stimuli were given;
later it was allowed to walk
across the board without
being thus stimulated; afterward
acoustical stimuli
were given it at various parts
of the maze.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img  src="images/i_597.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="caption">F<span class="smcapa">IG</span>. 5. Labyrinth H. For study of acoustical
association. Passages 6 in. wide, as before.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Eight animals were used.
All were found quite sensitive
to the electrical shocks,
and when next tested they
avoided the board, especially
if the gong sounded as they approached. Some would show
signs of uneasiness anywhere in the maze on hearing the gong. When
the board was so placed that they had to pass over it in reaching the
food, <em>when once on it</em> they moved very leisurely, often lingering;
and if they stepped upon the wire surface in the darkened maze, they
showed no evidence of being frightened. Evidently no association
had been formed between the peculiar tactual stimulus of touching
the wires and the electrical shocks which had at first been given. But
the tactual stimulus may have been below the threshold. Yerkes<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> saw
evidence of association of this kind in the frog; this animal, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[Pg 598]</a></span>
is probably much more sensitive to tactual stimulation received from
surfaces over which it passes than is the pigeon.</p>

<p>The results of these four experiments indicate that the pigeon
easily acquires complicated labyrinth habits; that these remain fixed
for some weeks at least; that acoustical, visual, and certain organic
data are the most important sensory factors; and that the process
of learning is one of "trial and error," in which the animal comes
to form such a close connection between the sense-data of the interior
of the box and those other sense-data arising from movements
involved in reaching the food, that when the box impressions are again
encountered the other sense-data are revived and readily condition
the proper movements. How much memory of eating was involved
in these tests cannot be told; but it was certainly not an essential
part of the mental act.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> Proper guidance throughout the course
was the main thing, and this was determined by definite sense-data.
That recognition, discrimination, and perhaps choice were to some
extent present seems likely from the animal's hesitating movements
at certain critical points. Thus it is highly probable that when the
bird approached a blind alley which it had always entered before (see
Fig. 2, stage 6), two alternatives were recognized, to enter, as before,
or not to do so, as was usual thereafter, and that the pause had for its
mental correlate a state closely bordering upon what in us would be
deliberation.</p>

<p>2. <em>Release experiments.</em> Under this heading are included certain
cage experiments in which some act, such as touching a lever, pecking,
or stepping upon a platform, resulted in the opening of the door, and
thus enabled the animal to escape and secure the food lying in view
without. The animal was admitted to the cage through an entrance
compartment as in the case of the maze trials. Before being tested it
was allowed to become familiar with the cage and to reach the food
directly by passing out through the open door. When first in the cage
the animals did not seem to notice the release apparatus, and hence
they probably did not begin learning the method of escape until later
when they entered the cage and found the door closed, and the ordinary
exit thus obstructed.</p>


<p class="p2b">A. <em>Latch Tests</em></p>

<p>The cage here employed was an 18-inch cubical box. The top was
of chicken wire and the bottom and three sides of heavy boards; the
fourth side was formed by narrow vertical bars and a wire door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[Pg 599]</a></span>
which opened inwardly and was held by a latch working on the outer
surface of the bars.   At first a long wooden latch was used, which
the animals raised when reaching out for food. As this seemed an
unnatural act, downward
pressure was substituted
by attaching to the latch,
now made smaller and of
brass, a string which ran
over a pulley above the
door and down into the
cage. As nooses did not
seem adapted to the birds,
the end of the string was
attached to a wooden lever
which worked on the inner
surface of the bars,
about three inches from
the floor.   Eight animals
were tested four times
daily (twice in the forenoon and twice in the afternoon) for ten days.
The time required to escape and the animals' behavior were recorded
as in the case of the labyrinth tests.</p>

<div class="caption"><blockquote><p class="left">F<span class="smcapa">IG</span>. 6. Curve of learning to operate latch,
plotted from last column of Table IV. Each vertical
division indicates 30 sec. The horizontal divisions
represent successive days.</p></blockquote>
 </div>
</div>

<p>When they first entered the box (singly as in the other experiments)
and found the usual exit closed they made various attempts to push
through between the bars, springing and often flying about with great
force and persistency. In course of their random movements they
touched the bar and opened the door and thus escaped. Later the
unnecessary movements were mostly dropped and the necessary ones
became highly specialized. The first association was established between
the box impressions received on entering and the movements
involved in approaching the front of the box and depressing the lever;
later a connection was formed between the sensations of touching the
lever, of hearing the sound of the opening door, of feeling the jar, etc.,
and the movements of turning away from the lever and passing out.
The sight of the opening door seemed to be of less service to the birds
than the sound and jar. Each animal soon came to touch the bar at the

<p>The periods here were similar to those given in the maze tests&mdash;the
time was long at first, then it shortened very rapidly for a few trials,
then more slowly but still constantly, until the act became thoroughly
familiar. The process was one of "trial and error" throughout. As
before, various lapses occurred, even although the animals were as
persistent as usual in their efforts to escape. When the lever was moved
to the side or back of the box, none of the animals could escape. In
general, pigeons show less ingenuity in dealing with latches than do
sparrows, according to Porter's<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> observations, although in some other
tests they are equally apt.</p>


<p class="p2b">B. <em>Pecking Tests</em></p>

<p>The preceding series of trials proved the animals' ability to utilize
certain touching or clawing movements, at first accidental, in making
an escape, and showed that these could become highly specialized.
Desiring to carry out similar tests in the case of pecking movements,
which are quite as natural to pigeons, I arranged a contrivance by
means of which the act of pecking at corn-grains fastened to a small
piece of cardboard (placed just outside the cage, but within easy reach
through an opening in the wire) would open the cage-door by making
a delicate electrical contact. Four animals were tested.</p>

<p>On entering the cage they endeavored to escape as before; failing
in this they began pecking about until they found the corn-grains and
made the contact which opened the door and allowed them to escape
to the food without. Three of the animals made their escape in this
way several times; but the habit seemed to be one that could not be
readily learned, as the successive periods showed little shortening.</p>

<p>Thinking that the pecking of things at a definite place perhaps complicated
the matter, I removed the electrical apparatus and arranged
to open the door myself by pulling a string whenever the pigeon pecked
anywhere upon entering the box. Preliminary experiments with Bird
J indicated some ability to profit by this kind of experience. As the act
of pecking could be used to advantage in a series of imitation trials,
this animal only was allowed to learn to escape by actually pecking;
the others were reserved for the imitation tests next to be reported.</p>


<p class="p2b">C. <em>Imitation Tests</em></p>

<p>In the experiments already reported the animals were used individually
and usually out of sight of the others, although in the same room
and within hearing of them. When efforts were made in some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[Pg 602]</a></span>
experiments to test the animals in a separate room, signs of fear and
discontent were often noticed, and it was necessary to return to the
first room to continue the tests. Some instances were noticed in which
a pigeon would do what it saw another doing. For example, one of my
subjects would not eat one day, being ill apparently; but when I put
two others into the compartment with it, and they began eating the
food lying about, it also began pecking. Its act could not have been
due to its only then happening to see the corn, for it had before looked
toward the food when this was thrown to it.</p>

<p>Desiring to test, under definite conditions, the imitative ability of
these animals, I arranged trials in which birds were allowed to see
a useful, but simple act performed by another bird, and then were
given an opportunity to execute the act themselves. Using the animal
which I had trained for the purpose, I allowed its series of acts
(entrance to box, pecking, release, and food-eating without) to be
observed by another animal, confined in a small wire compartment
(similar to the entrance compartment before used) attached to the side
of the large cage. Care was taken to see that the confined bird was
observing, or at least was looking toward the acting one; in case of
doubt, the trial was repeated. Later the trained animal was replaced
by the observing one, and the latter's reaction was noted. Five animals,
in all, were tested, and each was given two opportunities to
escape after having seen the trained animal perform the act ten successive
times. None of them, however, showed any signs of trying to
escape by repeating the movements so often performed by the bird
familiar with the act, but each rushed against the sides of the cage and
tried to push through at various places, just as the trained bird had
done when first learning the habit.</p>

<p>As the act, or series of acts, was rather too complex to be easily
observed and utilized by the other pigeons, I arranged two much
simpler tests. In one case the leading bird was taught to open the
cage-door by stepping upon a platform (the lowering of which made
an electrical contact); in the other, to avoid a blind alley, enter a short
passage, and ascend a wooden plane (inclined at an angle of thirty
degrees) which led into another box containing food. In these tests
it was more difficult for the series of acts to be viewed, but the animals,
singly as before, were placed at a point of vantage and apparently
saw the movements of the other animals.</p>

<p>Of the five birds tested in the platform experiment, four utterly
failed to escape in the two trials given. The fifth, in its second test,
went to the platform promptly and thus made its escape, but the success<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[Pg 603]</a></span>
may have been accidental, or due to the animal's experience
of seeing and approaching the platform in its first test. In the labyrinth
experiment only one bird (second test) avoided the blind alley
and went directly up the inclined plane to the food; this success was
probably due to experience in the first test. There was certainly no evidence
that the animals had grasped the nature of the problem; nothing
to indicate that the performance of the trained animal had supplied
data for the guidance of future conduct, that is, for the conditioning
of the necessary movements, in this case those of pecking, stepping
upon a platform, or avoiding a blind alley and ascending an inclined
plane.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<p>These results are similar to those which other experimenters have
secured in the case of chicks, cats, dogs, monkeys,<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> and also rats.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>
Although the method I employed is doubtless open to the criticism
of being artificial,<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> some value at least should be attached to the results;
if so it would seem probable that imitation in pigeons is not above the
"instinctive" stage, and that learning depends entirely upon first hand
experience, upon really doing the thing, and not upon merely seeing it
done.</p>

<p>3. <em>Position, Color and Form Tests.</em> The apparatus used in these
experiments consisted of small boxes, six inches in height, and open
at the top. Sometimes they were exactly similar, and sometimes they
differed in color or in form. They were moveably attached, six inches
apart, to a board which was placed in a large wire-covered box, having
an entrance compartment as in the case of the mazes and cages. Food
was placed in one of the small boxes, and the pigeons were allowed
to find it twice; later each bird was tested as to its ability to return to
the food by depending upon the position of the box in the group, or
upon its color or its form. Tests were given in series of six, and the
box which was first approached was recorded as the animal's choice
for that test. If it made a wrong selection, it was allowed to look about
until it found the box containing the food, but in no case was it permitted
to satisfy its hunger until the last test of the series. The animal
apparently did not see the food until it approached the box, and subsequent
tests demonstrated that it was not guided by odor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[Pg 604]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2b">A. <em>Position Tests</em></p>

<p>In this series of trials I used at first six, later nine food-boxes, four
inches square and covered with dark gray paper. The board to which
the several receptacles were fastened was shifted at irregular intervals
to various oblique angles; this was done to prevent the animal from
being assisted by the position of the food-box in the larger box rather
than in the group of similar boxes. After a bird had been tested sufficiently
for one position it was then used, for a week or so, in some
other experiment, and thus given an opportunity to forget, to some
extent at least, the old experience before being taught to find the food
in a box placed elsewhere in the group. For the positions 2, 3, and 4,
in the group of six similar boxes, eight animals were each given thirty
tests in series of six, as stated above. For the positions 5, 6, and 7, in
the group of nine similar boxes, the experiments were shortened. Six
animals were given twenty-four trials each, two animals for each of
the three positions.</p>

<p>The animals quickly learned the position of the food-box and passed
to it promptly when released from the entrance compartment. Changing
the position of the board to which the food-boxes were attached
did not affect the animals' ability to reach the food readily. They usually
selected the proper box as before, although frequently they went
around the end of the board and approached the food from the opposite
side. The general distribution of choices in the case of positions
2, 3, and 4 is given in Table V; the rate of learning, in Table VI.</p>

<p>With a single exception (Bird B, box 3) the box containing the food
was far more often chosen than any one of the empty boxes, and usually
more often than all of them combined, the average right choices
being: position 2, 62%; position 3, 57.7%; position 4, 53.3%. It will
be seen that the animals were more successful in finding the food in the
second position than in either the third or the fourth, that is, positions
nearer the end were more easily located. But what is of greater interest
to us is the rate of learning to go to the right box. This is indicated by
the increasing number of right choices from series to series. (Table
VI.) That the increase was small was due to the fact that the animals
learned so quickly in the first series of six tests that little improvement
could be made thereafter; what they could learn they acquired
early in the experiment. There is some evidence of improvement after
the first series in the case of box 4, a more difficult position, and the
average for all three boxes shows a slight improvement from series 1
to series 5, although a falling-off is seen in the last series: 26, 27, 27,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">[Pg 605]</a></span>
31, 28. The same general features appear in the case of the incomplete
tests (positions 5, 6, and 7). For each box there were, on the
average, 26 right choices in the possible 48. There were more right
choices in the case of box 7 than in the case of either box 6 or box 5,
box 7 being nearer one end (box 9). There was little evidence of
learning after the first series of trials.</p>

<p>The method of learning in these position tests was the same as that
noticed in previous experiments, namely, building upon chance successes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[Pg 606]</a></span>
When first admitted to the large box containing the row of
small ones at the farther end, the animal accidentally found the receptacle
containing the food, and later associated the movements involved
in reaching that position with various sense-impressions of the box,
especially those experienced upon entering&mdash;certain tactual impressions
of the small entrance compartment, sound of the lifting door and
sight given of the interior of the large box.</p>

<p>While the results clearly indicate that pigeons readily learn the
position of objects, nothing is proved as to "counting." Some experimenters
speak of similar trials as "number-tests," just as they do of
"form-tests," but this is probably going too far. To investigate counting
in animals, experiments should be arranged which minimize spatial
responses. These tests certainly show that pigeons can discriminate
positions readily, especially toward the ends of the group, but little more
is certainly indicated. Porter<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> says: "If we do not find in birds the
power to count, we have in their nice sense for the location of a member
of a series ... something of that preliminary number-sense which
Ribot describes as belonging to children and savages."</p>


<p class="p2b">B. <em>Color Tests</em></p>

<p>To investigate the animals' ability to utilize colors<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> in finding
their food, I employed the same apparatus as before, except that six
boxes were used throughout and each was covered with paper of a
different color: red, yellow, green, blue (Bradley's standards, except
red, <em>RO</em> being substituted), gray, and black. The boxes covered with
black and gray paper were employed merely to complete the group of
six. The same method as before was employed, except that the board
to which the boxes were attached was left stationary at the end of the
large box, and also that the position of all six boxes was changed irregularly
for each test.</p>

<p>The general behavior of the animals at the beginning of these tests
was quite similar to that shown in the preceding experiment; but it
was soon evident that colors occasioned them far more difficulty than
positions. The general distribution of choices is given in Table VII.
It will be seen that the proper box was usually chosen more often than
any one of the empty ones, but never oftener than the other five combined,
as occurred in the position tests; also that in the case of each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[Pg 607]</a></span>
color there were instances in which another color was as often, or more
often selected. Yet it is clear that colors may serve as valuable sense-data
for these animals. In the first series of six tests (see Table VIII)
there were few right choices or none, but in each succeeding series the
number increased. The learning process was evidently of the same type
as before observed (selection, in this case gradual, of chance but useful
movements), and involved visual data largely.</p>

<p>There is no evidence that the color-preference of the animals
assisted them in choosing correctly, in fact, they were rather less
successful in dealing with those colors for which they had previously
shown decided preference,<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> since the whole number of right choices
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[Pg 608]</a></span>was less in the case of the green and blue boxes (85) than in the case
of the red and yellow ones (92), and since there was a relative diminution
in the rate of learning toward the last in case of the former boxes.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>To test the animals' ability to discriminate shades of colors in finding
their food, two birds were used, with four boxes, each covered
with a different shade of red paper, and two with the boxes covered
with green paper. The brightness of the different shades was not
measured, but to the eye it seemed to be equal in each of the cases. The
food was placed in the box having the most nearly saturated color,
and twenty-four trials in series of six, as before, were given each bird.
The results were quite similar to those secured with different colors.
With the red shades there were twenty-two choices of the best saturated
shade to eight, ten, and eight, respectively, of the other three;
and with green, twenty-one to nine, ten, and eight. The 43 correct
choices were distributed from series 1 to series 4 as follows: 7, 11, 12,
and 13, which shows learning as before. The relatively large number
of right choices was probably due, partially to the fact that fewer alternative
choices were possible since only four boxes were used, instead
of six, and partially to the fact that the box containing the food may
have been slightly brighter than the others.</p>

<p>Throughout these trials the position-element was a decidedly disturbing
factor. When the animals were first learning to choose a box
of a definite color, some would show a marked tendency to approach
a receptacle occupying a certain position, and would persist in this
from series to series. Others at first showed no special preference
for certain positions, but, after happening to make a correct choice,
they would return to that same place the next time, and thus miss the
right box which had been changed for the new test.</p>


<p class="p2b">C. <em>Form Tests.</em></p>

<p>In this experiment the six food-boxes were each of different form:
triangular, square, oblong, hexagonal, circular, and elliptical. They
were of the same capacity, and were covered with light-brown paper.
As in the preceding experiment, the birds were tested for only four
of the boxes, and were given thirty trials each. Six animals were used,
and as they were not the same as those previously employed, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">[Pg 609]</a></span>
square box (which had always been used before) had no advantage
over the others in attracting the birds at the beginning of the trials.
The tests were given as in the preceding experiment, except that it
did not seem necessary to change the position of each of the six forms
before giving each test; it was thought sufficient to move the food-box,
and, if a wrong choice had been made in the preceding test, also the
box wrongly chosen. The results are shown in Tables IX and X.</p>

<p>It will be seen that each animal chose the right box oftener than
any other one box, but not oftener than all of them; also that there
was a small increase in the number of right choices from series to
series. No one of the four forms seemed better discriminated than the
others if we may judge from the practical equality of right choices
made in each case (55, 53, 55, 52) or from the similar increase in number
of right choices from series to series; the hexagonal and cylindrical
boxes received fewer choices in the first series than did the triangular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">[Pg 610]</a></span>
and square, but this was exactly counterbalanced in the last
series. The triangular box was more often confused with hexagonal
and square, and the square with triangular and oblong, than with
the others. For the hexagonal box the cylindrical was more frequently
mistaken than were the other forms, especially the oblong;
and with the cylindrical the elliptical was more frequently confused
than were the others, especially the oblong. In this series of tests
nothing new as regards general behavior or method of learning was
observed.</p>

<p>If we compare the results obtained in these three experiments (see
Table XI and Fig. 7), we shall see that the pigeons were governed
much more by the position of the food-box than by either its color or
its form, and that color was better associated than form. Position
was a most important factor throughout, as was observed also by
Porter<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> in the case of the English sparrow. Porter<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> also found that
his sparrows could associate color better than form. In the position-tests
the pigeons showed very little improvement from series to series
(see table); almost all that the animals could learn was acquired at the
beginning. The more difficult color- and form-trials, however, showed
almost constant improvement, although we should have expected this
to be greater in the latter case than it was. When judged entirely by the
actual number of right choices in a given kind of tests, some of the birds
made a very poor showing; but from the standpoint of increasing
number of right choices they appeared in a wholly different light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611">[Pg 611]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus, for example, bird F (Table VII) made only 33 right choices
in a possible 120, yet their arrangement is significant, being, from
series 1 to series 5, respectively, 1, 5, 7, 10, 10. It is probable that there
would have been still greater improvement had the tests been continued;
perhaps the animal would have become as proficient in finding its food
by depending upon the color of the receptacle usually containing it,
as by relying upon the position of the box in the group.</p>

<h4>V. S<span class="smcapa">UMMARY</span></h4>

<p>1. Respiration in pigeons is sensitive to various stimuli, and since
its alterations of rate, amplitude, etc., can be easily recorded pneumo-graphically
without frightening the animals, it may well serve as a
process through which to study their mental life.</p>

<p>2. By repetition meaningless stimuli, for example, pistol-shots,
quickly lose their disturbing influence; whereas the breathing remains
sensitive to those of a significant character, such as the noises
made by other birds.</p>

<p>3. Reaction to light of moderate intensity consists principally in an
immediate quickening, the amount varying with the color; since a
direct correspondence was found between color-preference and breathing-rate,
it would seem that here agreeable feeling involves increased
breathing activity.</p>

<p>4. Visual, acoustical, probably tactual, and certainly organic data,
are the principal sensory factors of the associations of pigeons.</p>

<p>5. The animals readily form useful associations by a method of
"trial and error," or the selection of successful movements which were
at first accidental.</p>

<p>6. Apparently a pigeon does not learn by merely seeing a new act
performed by another pigeon; yet there are instances of simple ("instinctive")
imitation, and "trial and error" learning is not wholly
independent of social conditions, since it proceeds much more satisfactorily
if the animal is trained at least within hearing distance of
other pigeons.</p>

<p>7. When a habit is being formed, the "period" required for the
first test is usually very long, but learning proceeds quite rapidly during
the next few trials; later it is more gradual, but it continues till the act
becomes thoroughly familiar.</p>

<p>8. Associations are fairly permanent, and some remain practically
unaltered for at least six weeks. Modification is easily accomplished,
however, on the basis of new experience.</p>

<p>9. Pigeons differ widely both as to the ease with which they acquire
associations and also as to their permanence. Difference in activity
seems the chief reason for this.</p>

<p>10. While these birds seem mentally inferior to English sparrows
and to various mammals which have been tested in a similar manner,
they are capable of numerous ready adjustments. They discover circuitous
labyrinth passages, they learn to manipulate latch apparatus
when adapted to their natural habits and conveniently placed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">[Pg 613]</a></span>
they easily reach their food by depending upon the position, color, or
form of the box containing it. But the process is apparently simple
association throughout. There is no evidence of higher mental activity&mdash;no
looking the situation over and acting accordingly, no "reasoning"
in the proper sense of the word, but only blind movements,
some of which are retained and become highly specialized, merely
because successful.</p>

<h2><a name="REACTIONS_OF_THE_CRAYFISH" id="REACTIONS_OF_THE_CRAYFISH"></a>REACTIONS OF THE CRAYFISH</h2>

<p class="p1b">BY J. CARLETON BELL</p>


<p>The crayfish has long been the typical Crustacean for anatomical
and physiological investigations, but it is only recently that its reactions
to sensory stimuli have been made the object of experimental
study. The purpose of this paper is to describe the reactions of the
animal to certain sensory stimuli under experimental conditions,
and to estimate the relative importance of these stimuli in the life
of the organism.</p>


<h4>I. R<span class="smcapa">EACTIONS</span> <span class="smcapa">TO</span> V<span class="smcapa">ISUAL</span> S<span class="smcapa">TIMULI</span></h4>

<p>Huxley<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> states that crayfish avoid direct sunlight, hiding under
stones during the day, and becoming active in the evening. On the
other hand, they are attracted like moths to fires lighted on the bank
at night, and may be scooped out by hand. Abbott,<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> giving an account
of the burrowing crayfish, <em>Cambarus diogenes</em>, states that it is
very difficult to observe the animals at work, since all their digging
is done at night. It would seem from the account of Miss Hoppin,
quoted by Garman,<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> that the blind crayfish, <em>Cambarus pellucidus</em>,
is not altogether insensitive to light, for, reporting on the fauna of
the caves of Missouri, she says that the crayfish are all found near
the entrance to the cave, where there is considerable light. In the
dark recesses there are only little white fishes. Blind fish and crayfish
are also taken from the wells in the neighborhood, where the
crayfish are found only in wells that are rather shallow and light;
the fish, on the other hand, are only obtained from deep, dark wells.</p>

<p>According to the above accounts it would appear that the crayfish
is negatively phototactic to direct sunlight or diffuse daylight, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">[Pg 616]</a></span>
positively phototactic to a light at night, and moreover, that light
may influence the behavior of the animal even when the eyes have
ceased to function.</p>

<p>The directive influence of light upon the movements of the crayfish
has never been experimentally studied to my knowledge. Dearborn<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>
thinks that light has no effect upon the animals. Yerkes<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>
and Towle<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> have shown that Daphnia move toward the light.
Bethe<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> finds that Carcinus is negatively phototactic, and also shows
a tendency to hunt out corners. When the eyes are varnished with
lampblack, the phototaxis disappears, but the tendency to seek out
corners still remains. Bethe says that he has observed the same
phenomenon in the crayfish. Keeble and Gamble<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> discovered that
<em>Hippolyte varians</em> responds positively to light under all conditions,
and PalÃ¦mon is just as markedly negative. <em>Macromysis</em>, however,
reacted now positively now negatively, depending on the background.
A black (absorbing) background called forth a positive response,
while a white (scattering) background produced a negative reaction.
Spaulding,<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> in studying the habits of the Hermit Crab (<em>Eupagurus</em>),
found that it is strikingly positively phototactic. When animals are
placed in an aquarium, one half of which is shaded, none of them
are ever noticed inside of the dark line. Herrick<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> notes that lobsters
are nocturnal, and avoid the light when placed in a tank, and Bateson<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>
says that prawns and shrimps lie hidden during the day, and
are active only at night. Parker,<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> in a study of Copepods, finds
that the females have a strong positive phototaxis for light of a low<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">[Pg 617]</a></span>
intensity, while males show a weak negative phototaxis. To light
of over 100-candle power at a distance of 10 cm. or to direct sunlight
the female Copepods are negative, while the reaction of the males
does not seem to be altered.</p>

<p>In his work on <em>Carcinus</em>, Bethe obtained retraction of the eye-stalks
by suddenly throwing a strong light on the eye by means of a mirror.
"Usually the eyes were quickly drawn in and protruded again, sometimes
several times in rapid succession, like a man blinking under
a sudden, strong light." When a dark object, the size of the hand,
was moved just over the water, the eyes were seldom retracted, but
the antennules were usually drawn in. Lemoine<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> observed that in
Astacus retraction was due to touch alone, and that no light, however
strong, was able to bring about such a reaction. Gulland<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> takes
just the opposite view with reference to Astacus, stating that there
are no setÃ¦ of any sort on the eye-stalk, and therefore it is insensitive
to touch, but is withdrawn only because the animal sees the object
by which the stimulus is given. If a curved needle is used, and the
stimulus is applied from behind, no retraction follows. Dearborn,<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>
however, working with Cambarus, agrees with Lemoine in saying,
"Withdrawal of the ophthalmites into their sockets occurs only on
contact with some hard object,&mdash;not from any light-stimulus of an
ordinary sort." I may say in passing that in none of the following
experiments on Cambarus was there ever a sign of retraction due to
stimulation by light, the retraction always taking place in response
to a touch-stimulus.</p>

<p>Lyon,<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> in his study of compensatory movements of the eye-stalks,
found that when the eyes were painted with lampblack, the crayfish
showed a reduction of about 10% in the compensatory movements
when rotated in vertical planes, but the compensation remained the
same for rotation about the dorsi-ventral axis. On rotation in the
dark the compensatory movement of the eyes was found to be from
5&deg; to 8&deg; less than in the light.</p>

<h4>E<span class="smcapa">XPERIMENTAL</span></h4>

<p>In the investigations to be described, 58 crayfish of the species
<em>Cambarus affinis</em> were made use of, and for identification the animals
were marked on the back with white enamel paint, the males receiving
the even numbers from 2 to 64, the females the odd numbers
from 1 to 51.</p>


<p class="p2b">1. <em>Reactions to White Light</em></p>

<p>The questions proposed for investigation were, (<em>a</em>) How does the
crayfish react to diffuse daylight; (<em>b</em>) to reflected sunlight; (<em>c</em>) to
direct sunlight; (<em>d</em>) to artificial light of different intensities? (<em>e</em>)
What is the influence of previous conditions of exposure to light
upon the reactions of the animal? (<em>f</em>) Do changes of temperature
affect the reactions?</p>

<p>A wooden box, 80 cm. long, 25 cm. wide, and 20 cm. high, painted
black on the inside, and constructed so as to hold water, was covered
with a heavy black cloth to exclude the light from above. The front
end of the box was of glass, thus admitting the light from the end.
In all the experiments except those with direct sunlight, this glass
end was covered with black cardboard in which a hole 10 cm. long
and 5 cm. high had been so cut that the light was admitted at the
middle of the bottom of the glass. The direct sunlight was admitted
through the whole of the glass end. At the rear of the box a piece
of black cardboard was so arranged that an aperture was afforded
for observing the animals without admitting any appreciable amount
of light, and this aperture could be readily closed by a slide when
not in use.</p>

<p>The method of experimentation was to place the animal in the
box about 20 cm. from the glass end, and observe whether it went
toward or away from the source of light. The animals were experimented
on in two groups of five each, and one hundred observations
were made on the individuals of each group with each intensity of
light, that is, twenty observations on each animal. In order to check
the influence of the orientation of the animal at the time of exposure
to the stimulus, the following four positions for placing the animal
were chosen: (1) Head toward the light; (2) Head away from the
light; (3) At right angles to the light with right side toward it; (4)
At right angles with the left side toward the light. Thus five observations
were made on each animal of each group in each position,
exposed to each of the different intensities of light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">[Pg 619]</a></span></p>

<p>Seven different intensities of light were employed, and the results
have been arranged in eight sets, as follows: I. Diffuse daylight
in dry box, <em>i. e.</em>, the animals were taken out of their ordinary medium,
water, and were exposed to the stimulus of diffuse daylight in the
air. The reactions under these conditions, however, were so slow
and so unsatisfactory that the test was abandoned after the first group,
and thus the second group has nothing to show for itself under this
head. The remaining seven sets of observations were made on animals
placed in 10 cm. of water at 15&deg; C. II. Diffuse daylight. III.
Reflected sunlight. The box was placed near a window on a clear
day, and the sunlight was thrown in horizontally by means of a mirror.
IV. Direct sunlight. On a clear day the box was placed in such
a position that the sun shone in directly and illuminated the front
half of it. V. 9-candle-power incandescent electric light. This lamp
was marked 16 c., but it had been used a great deal, and on being
tested with a Lummer-Brodhun photometer showed only 9 c. VI.
An incandescent electric light of about 50 c. This lamp was marked
100 c., but had been used considerably and was slightly smoked. Unfortunately
it was broken before there was any opportunity to test
it. Judging from the fact that another 100 c. lamp of the same manufacture,
in slightly better condition, measured 64 c., the estimate of
50 c. seemed a safe one. VII. The incandescent electric light alluded
to above, which measured 64 c. VIII. An arc light which varied in
intensity from 150 c. to 250 c.</p>

<p>In intensities V and VI the lamp was placed 5 cm. from the glass
end of the box to allow the interposition of a heat-screen consisting
of an alum solution in a flat glass jar 5 cm. thick. Reckoned in candle-metres,
therefore, the intensity of the illumination at the surface
of the animal in V was 144 c. m., and that in VI was about 800 c. m.
In VII two heat-screens were used, and between these was placed
a lens of considerable but not accurately determined curvature, so
that it is impossible to express the intensity in candle-metres. In
VIII the light was so variable that such an expression would mean
nothing.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it was impossible to keep the two groups constant
throughout the whole series, owing to the death of two individuals
in each group during the experimentation. Group 1 was composed
of nos. 1, 3, 4, 8, and 9, of which 1 and 8 were replaced by nos. 13
and 42 respectively. Group 2 was begun with nos. 23, 27, 32, 34,
and 38, and the vacancies caused by the death of 23 and 32 were
filled by nos. 21 and 36. The following table exhibits the reactions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">[Pg 620]</a></span>
to the different intensities of light, + indicating an orientation toward
the source of light, - an orientation away from the light, and Â± an
indifferent orientation, which usually means no movement at all.</p>

for each group. The time of each animal in seconds was noted with
a stop-watch from the instant the animal was placed in the box until
a definite orientation was assumed with reference to the light. If

<p>Inspection of these tables shows that when the animals were taken
from the water and placed in diffuse daylight in the air (I), their
movements were so sluggish that in twenty-nine cases out of one hundred
there was no orientation within the three-minute limit. Moreover,
in the seventy-one cases where there was definite orientation
the average time was over two minutes (144 seconds). While, therefore,
the conditions were quite different from the normal environment
of the animal, it is interesting to note that of the cases where
orientation did take place the negative reactions were more than
twice as many as the positive. In II, where the animals were under
the same conditions of diffuse daylight but in the water, a wide variation
in the reactions of the two groups is noted. In group 1 they
are about equally divided between positive and negative, while in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">[Pg 621]</a></span>
group 2 there is the largest proportion of negative reactions in the
whole series. It will be observed that the time for group 1 is extremely
long compared with the other averages, and this doubtless
indicates a general sluggishness and lack of sensitiveness to stimuli
in the animals, which might to some extent account for the difference
in reaction. If we consider the totals of both groups for each intensity,
we are led to conclude that there is no appreciable difference
in the reactions of crayfish to diffuse daylight, to sunlight, or to artificial
light within the limits here employed. A slight exception to
this is found in VII, where the 64 c. lamp with the lens caused a somewhat
more uniform negative reaction. The action of direct sunlight
in IV is rather remarkable in that with the lowest proportion of negative
reactions in the whole series we also observe the shortest time-average,
indicating that the animals are the liveliest and most sensitive.
This would seem to indicate that while the animals are in
general somewhat negatively phototactic to all light-stimuli of moderate
intensity the action of direct sunlight tends to reduce the negative
phototaxis to a minimum. If we consider the totals of the two groups
separately we observe that group 1 has only 57% of negative reactions
while group 2 shows 68%. This is rather in accordance with what
we would expect from the general time-average, which is over three
times as much for group 1 as for group 2. But although we may in
a general way connect rapidity of orientation with a large percentage
of negative reactions, it will not do to carry it to individual cases,
for it was observed that no. 27 showed 83% of its reactions negative,
yet its total time-average was 10 sec., the highest in its group.</p>

<p>In general, then, we conclude that the crayfish is negatively phototactic
in the proportion of about two to one. This apparently contradicts
the statement made by Huxley that crayfish "are attracted
like moths to fires lighted on the bank at night." For surely if this
were the case some such tendency would have been observed in these
experiments. On the other hand, there is no such marked and definite
response to light as in the case of Daphnia or Hippolyte or PalÃ¦mon
or the Hermit Crab. The action of the stimulus is by no means mechanical
and constant, but there is wide variation in individuals.</p>

<p>As was mentioned in the description of the method of experimentation,
four different positions for placing the animal were chosen with
the idea that the initial position of the animal with respect to the
light might have some influence on the direction of its movement.
To determine what this influence might be, a careful record was
kept of the orientation with reference to each one of these positions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">[Pg 622]</a></span>
and the following table gives a summary of these observations. In
the table position I is where the animal is placed with its head toward
the light; position II, with head away from the light; position III,
at right angles to the light with the right side toward it; position IV,
at right angles with left side to light.</p>

<p>Since the animals have been shown to be somewhat negatively
phototactic, we should expect that position II, with the head away
from the light, would show the largest number of negative reactions,
and this is what we find if we take the sum of both groups. But by
the same course of reasoning we should expect position I, with head
toward the light, to yield the smallest number of negative reactions,
a condition which prevails neither in the sum nor in either of the
groups. On the whole we can only say that difference of position
seems to have remarkably little influence on the orientation of the
animals.</p>

<p>In his work on the eye of the crayfish, Parker<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> called attention to
the migration of the pigment in the retinular cells under the influence
of light. The question now arose, what influence, if any, does
this pigment migration exert upon the reactions of the crayfish to
light? The time required for pigment migration in the eye of the
crayfish has never been determined to my knowledge, but from the
work of Parker<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> on PalÃ¦monetes it was thought that confinement
in the dark for about an hour would be sufficient to bring about a
retraction of the pigment. Accordingly, group 1 was kept in the dark
for one hour, group 2 for one hour and a half, before experimentation.
A further test was made to observe the effects of pigment
expansion, both groups having been exposed for one hour and a half
to the rays of a 32 c. incandescent electric light at a distance of 40 cm.
The apparatus used in the reaction-tests was the box described above,
with the 64 c. light as a stimulus. As to the method of observation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">[Pg 623]</a></span>
each group was placed in the centre of the box at right angles to the
horizontal rays of light, and the position of each animal was accurately
noted at intervals of one minute for one hour. In reporting the results,
all the observations of animals in the half of the box nearest the light
are denominated positive, those in the half farthest from the light
negative. The results are given in Table IV, where line I indicates
the reactions after confinement in the dark, line II those after exposure
to the light.</p>

<p>Let it be said at once that these results do not offer an altogether
satisfactory basis for an answer to the question proposed above.
Some of the animals would take up a position during the first ten
minutes and remain in it for the rest of the hour. Whether the position
taken was due solely to the light, or was owing to thigmotactic
influences, or whether it depended on the way in which the animal
was released, are questions which cannot be answered, and for this
reason the conclusions to be drawn from the table are tentative. If
we examine the table we find that the totals of both groups agree
in manifesting a decrease in negative results for line II, after exposure
to the light, as compared with line I, after confinement in
the dark. This is what we would expect from negatively phototactic
animals. When taken from the dark the pigment is retracted, and
the sensitive retinal substance is exposed to the direct action of a
rather strong light. The negative tendency of the animal we should
expect to find accentuated. The decrease in negative reactions is
especially marked with group 2, which was shown above to be much
the livelier of the two, and all the individuals except no. 27 share
in the change. In group 1 the decrease is not so striking, and is
observed to be due to two individuals solely. Inexplicable is the
preponderance of positive over negative reactions in the results for
group 1.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">[Pg 624]</a></span></p>

<p>All of the experiments thus far described were carried out in water
at approximately 15&deg; C. The question naturally arises, what will
be the result of raising or lowering the temperature upon the reactions
of the animals to light? Unfortunately the experiments anent
this question are fragmentary and incomplete, but the results will
be given for what they are worth. The same apparatus and the same
intensity of light (64 c.) were used as in the preceding paragraph.
The results, presented in Table V, are arranged in three sets, as
follows: The line marked I represents the results obtained from
group 1 at a temperature of 5&deg; C. The animals were placed in the
box one at a time, as in Table I, and their orientation noted. They
were set at right angles to the rays of light, five times with the right
and five with the left side toward the source of the stimulus. No
observations were made upon group 2 at 5&deg; C., and those on group 1
are so few as to have a questionable value. Line II gives the reactions
of both groups of animals in water at 25&deg; C., and in this set the animals
were placed in all four of the positions indicated for Table III.
Line III presents the reactions of the animals in water at 25&deg; C. by
the method outlined for Table IV, <em>i. e.</em>, each group of animals was
placed in the centre of the box, and observed at intervals of one
minute. To obviate the objection of the animals remaining in one
spot, they were reset every ten minutes in the middle of the box, at
right angles to the entering rays.</p>

<p>Judging from lines II and III we may say that there is a tendency
toward a decrease of the negative phototaxis with an increase in temperature.
It is true that group 1 in line III maintains the average,
62% negative reactions, but the others are much lower than this,
line II even going over to positive phototaxis in both groups. In line
III the animals of both groups were extremely active during the first
ten minutes, rushing about from one end of the box to the other,
pushing each other back and forth, and in general exhibiting great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_625" id="Page_625">[Pg 625]</a></span>
restlessness. Some of the animals when first put into the water
reacted with a sort of cramp reflex, which was followed in a few
seconds by intense activity. After the first ten minutes the animals
began to grow more quiet, and in twenty or thirty minutes they had
become quite sluggish, scarcely moving out of the position in which
they were reset. During the period of restlessness the males showed
marked sexual activity, rushing up to the females, pushing them
about, seizing them, and trying to turn them over in spite of their
vigorous resistance. One of the males, no. 36, did succeed in turning
a female on her back twice, although she struggled violently to
escape,&mdash;a thing which the female never does in the ordinary sexual
act. The rise in temperature, therefore, seemed to stimulate the
males to sexual activity, but not the females.</p>


<p class="p2b">2. <em>Reactions to Colored Light</em></p>

<p>No observations have ever been made, so far as I know, on the
reactions of the crayfish to colored light. Lyon, in his work on compensatory
eye-movements, found that rotation in blue light gave a
compensatory movement only slightly less than that in white light,
while in red light the compensation was only a little larger than in
darkness. In some animals the interposition of an opaque object
between the eye and the source of light caused an elevation of the
eye 1&deg; or 2&deg; toward the vertical. Red glass acted like an opaque
object, blue glass produced no effect, <em>i. e.</em>, blue light had the same
effect as white light. To observe whether the same thing applied to
movement reactions was the object of the following experiments.</p>

<p><em>a. Reactions to Horizontal Colored Light.</em> The same apparatus
was used as in the previous experiments, viz., the dark box with light
from the 64 c. lamp entering horizontally at the end. Across half of
this end were placed pieces of colored glass of a saturated blue, green,
yellow, and red. The colored light obtained by this means was not
spectrally pure, but it was the nearest to it that could be obtained.
A more serious objection is that the intensities were not the same,
the red and the yellow being very appreciably brighter than the blue
and the green. In addition to observations with these colors, a piece
of black cardboard was introduced in the same position as the glass,
thus cutting off the light from that half of the box. This, to preserve
the uniformity of the series, is denominated black. The animals
were placed in the centre of the box, on the line separating the white
from the colored light, and were observed at intervals of one minute
for forty minutes, the position of each animal being accurately noted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">[Pg 626]</a></span>
At the end of every ten minutes the animals were reset at the centre
of the box. The following table gives a summary of the results for
each individual. Here again it was impossible to keep the groups
constant owing to the death of individuals during the progress of the
experiment.</p>

<p>In this table the colored lights are arranged in the order of the
spectrum from blue to red. On the hypothesis that blue light has
practically the same effect upon animal reactions as white light,
while red is about the same as darkness, we might expect that the
reactions would be about equally divided between the blue and the
white, and that there would be a gradually increasing difference in
number as we go down the table, reaching the maximum with the
last pair, black-white. This, we see, however, is not quite the case.
In both groups the white has a slightly larger number of reactions
than the blue, while the pair green-white shows numbers more nearly
equal. In the sum totals the yellow shows a greater preponderance
over the white than any other color, and the black and white are
very nearly equal. Group 1, it is true, shows a fairly regular ascending
scale in reactions to the colored lights with the exception of the
red, and the same might be said of group 2 if it were not for the very
low number of reactions to the black and the exceptionally high
showing of the yellow. On the whole, however, the differences are
so small and the individual variations are so large that we can only
conclude that for these conditions colored light has little or no effect
on the reactions of the animals.</p>

<p>In the foregoing experiment the light came from a broad spiral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627">[Pg 627]</a></span>
coil inside the bulb of the lamp, and the distance from it to the edge
of the glass was so small compared with the length of the box that there
was no sharp dividing-line between the colored light and the white,
but rather a wedge-shaped block of lessening saturation of the color,
and this wedge, having the point toward the light, took up the whole
of the box at the extreme farther end. Thus the imaginary central
line dividing the white light from the colored departed farther and
farther from the reality as the rear of the box was approached. To
obviate this difficulty and to get a check on the previous work, the
following series of experiments was undertaken.</p>

<p><em>b. Reactions to Vertical Colored Light.</em> The same box was used as
in the previous experiments, but the end was closed with a black
cloth, and an electric light marked 32 c. but measuring only 22 c. was
hung exactly over the middle of the box, 40 cm. from the bottom. By
means of wires it was arranged that a plate of colored glass could be
swung in such a manner that all of one half the box (the whole of one
end) was illuminated with the desired color, while the other half
was either left white or illuminated with another color. In this way
there was a fairly sharp dividing-line between the two colors. The
animals were observed at intervals of one minute for 40 minutes, and
reset at the middle on the dividing-line every ten minutes as before.
Table VII gives the results of the observations.</p>

<p>In this set of experiments it was possible to keep the groups intact
except that in group 1 no. 13 had to be replaced by no. 46. If now
we conceive the colors arranged in the order of the spectrum with
black at one end and white at the other, and consider the black a
lower stimulus than the white, we have the ascending series black,
red, yellow, green, blue, white. Now since the animals have already
been shown to be somewhat negatively phototactic, we should expect
them to prefer a color of lower stimulus to one of higher. Turning
to the sum totals in the table we find that the first color of each pair
(which is always the lower stimulus) has the larger number of reactions
in every case but one, the first pair of red-blue. As was
stated above, it was impossible to secure colored light of the same
intensity by means of the glass at our disposal, and in the present
case the red was considerably brighter than the blue. Owing to the
fact already mentioned that different intensities of white light seem
to have no effect on the reactions it was thought that these differences
in the intensities of the colored lights might be overlooked. Since
the only thing that could be thought of to account for the anomalous
behavior to the red-blue was this difference in intensity, another experiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628">[Pg 628]</a></span>
was undertaken with the same animals under slightly
different conditions. A glass aquarium about 40 cm. long by 20 cm.
wide was covered with black cardboard and black cloth in such a
manner that light could enter only through a space 5 cm. wide at the
bottom of each end. Each of these ends was covered, the one with
blue, the other with red glass, and 15 cm. from each end was placed
an electric light marked 32 c. Later, however, it was found that one
of these lamps measured 30 c. and the other 22 c. The red light was
found to be much more intense to the eye than the blue, so the former
was damped down with tissue paper until the two appeared to have the
same intensity. The second pair of red-blue in Table VII gives the
results of the observations under these conditions, and these are
found to be in harmony with the rest of the table, <em>i. e.</em>,[236] the color giving
the lower stimulus has the higher number of reactions.</p>

<p>The most striking feature of the table is the marked predominance
of the red over the white. Here the red reaches 73% of the total
number of reactions, and inspection shows that this predominance
is uniform not only through the groups but even for the individuals.
The constancy of this reaction and the fact that it is so much more
frequent than the one to the black as compared with the white, would
lead one to expect that the red would have the higher percentage in
the combination black-red. Such, however, is not found to be the
case, although it does happen with one group. If the arrangement of
our color-scale in accordance with increasing intensity of stimulus
were correct, we should expect a gradually increasing predominance
in reactions to colored light over those to white in the first five pairs.
Instead of this we find that green and yellow stand nearest to the white,
blue and black come next and are almost equal, while red is very
much higher than any. In the pairs black-red and black-blue the
red holds its predominance over the blue at about the same rate as in
the second pair of the direct comparison, red-blue. The wide individual
variations, however, in all these reactions to colored light, except
perhaps in the case of red-white, indicate that there is nothing very
regular, stereotyped, or mechanical about them. The most that can
be said is that in a general way the red end of the spectrum furnishes
a less intense stimulus to negative reaction than the blue.</p>

<p>A tendency to habit formation was noticed during the course of
these experiments, and it is possible that this may have influenced
the results somewhat. Many individuals apparently formed a habit
of going to a certain corner as soon as they were reset at the centre.
The positions in which they were set were varied and they were headed
in different directions, but within a minute after they were released
in the middle of the box they would be found in their favorite corner.
This was especially the case with no. 38 in Table VI, and I think
accounts in some measure for the persistent avoidance of the white.
In no case did this continue throughout the whole series, but would
sometimes be noted for two or three days at a time in the case of an
individual. What were the controlling factors in this habit formation,
the means by which orientation and recognition were effected, I was
unable to determine.</p>


<p class="p2b">3. <em>Reactions to Objects</em></p>

<p>In no case did an animal give any sign of perceiving stationary objects
in its path or of avoiding them in any way that could be referred
to a visual stimulus. When the animal approached an obstruction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">[Pg 630]</a></span>
there was no hesitation in the movement until the object was touched.
Usually even when the antenna had touched the object the animal
did not stop, but continued until the contact of the chelÃ¦ or even
of the rostrum made further movement in that direction impossible.</p>

<p>With moving objects the case was quite different. Here the condition
and disposition of the individual animal seemed to be the
deciding factors. Often when the animals were trying to climb out
of a shallow pan in which they were kept in the experimenting-room,
raising a finger or holding out a pencil would be sufficient to make
them stop or even start back into the pan. Nor was this response
occasioned by any change in the intensity of light, such as that
caused by a shadow falling on the animal, for they would react to
a movement made on the opposite side of them from the window. In
fact, no. 56, the most active in response to moving objects, seemed to
react more vigorously to a motion made on the opposite side than
when it was made between him and the light. Whenever a person
came near the aquarium he and one or two others would take an
attitude of defence, and would "face about" to correspond to any
movement the person made toward one side or the other. When in
the pan mentioned above, any movement of a person within two or
three yards of him usually called forth a reaction on his part, and if
the pan were placed on the table and the person moved slowly round
it, the animal turned with the person, making a complete circuit of
the pan.</p>

<p>Reaction to a smaller moving object, however, was not so marked.
A black object, 20Ã8Ã8 cm., was suspended above the middle of
the pan so that if set swinging it would just pass over the top. When
it was pulled to one side the animal responded slightly, but after the
first swing he seemed to pay no more attention to it. When the operator
stepped out from behind the screen, the animal was as keen in its
response as before. The experiment was now tried of allowing the
object to approach from one direction while the operator moved to
a position at right angles to its line of movement. Without hesitation
the animal moved so as to keep fronting the operator, without paying
any attention to the movement of the smaller object, although this
was much nearer.</p>

<p>These observations on the reactions of the crayfish to stationary and
moving objects are in line with the conclusions of Plateau<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> and
Exner<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> drawn from observations on other Arthropods. It is Exner's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">[Pg 631]</a></span>belief that the compound eye is a visual apparatus which is almost
worthless for detecting the <em>forms</em> of objects, especially if these objects
are stationary, but that it may furnish a very keen perception of <em>moving</em>
objects.</p>


<h4>II. E<span class="smcapa">XPERIMENTS</span> <span class="smcapa">WITH</span> S<span class="smcapa">OUNDS</span></h4>

<p>Hensen<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> stated that PalÃ¦mon and Mysis reacted to sounds made
by striking a thin, resonant board floating on the surface of the water,
or by tapping the walls of the aquarium or of the room. Beer<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>
repeated Hensen's experiments, but denied that the Crustacea reacted
to sounds, and claimed that their movements were due to visual and
tactual stimuli. Prentiss<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> confirmed Beer's results on PalÃ¦monetes,
and noted that the reactions were only slightly diminished by the
removal of the otocysts, but that removal of the antennÃ¦ and antennules
caused their almost complete cessation. More extended experiments
were made on the fiddler crab, <em>Gelasimus pugilator</em>, which is
on land a good deal of the time, and Prentiss's conclusions are: "(1)
The reactions formerly attributed to sound-stimuli are nothing more
than tactile reflexes. (2) The otocyst has little or no part in calling
forth these reactions. (3) There is no direct evidence to prove that
decapod Crustacea hear, and until such evidence has been obtained,
we are not warranted in ascribing to the otocyst a true auditory
function."</p>

<p>The experiments performed on the crayfish in this connection all
resulted negatively and go to confirm Beer's and Prentiss's conclusions.
Rapping upon a board floating in the water, and tapping the sides
of the aquarium did not cause the slightest apparent reaction in the
animals under observation, even though the vibration of the water
could be plainly perceived by the sense of touch in the hand. When
a rather large electric bell was sounded just over the surface of the
water some reactions were observed which were evidently due to the
movements of the hammer, but there was nothing which could be
referred to the sound-stimuli. If the bell was held against the sides
of the aquarium, or in the water near the animals, the vibration could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_632" id="Page_632">[Pg 632]</a></span>
be plainly felt by the fingers, yet no reactions on the part of the crayfish
were observed. A metal snapper making a crack like a small
pistol-shot was tried both in and out of the water but with no success
in producing a reaction. A large hand tuning-fork, when held with its
base pressed firmly against the glass walls of the aquarium, gave a
deep rich tone of great volume, or when lightly touched to the glass
produced a shrill, piercing, penetrating sound which was extremely
sharp and disagreeable. Here again the vibrations of the water were
quite perceptible to the hand at a distance of 10 cm., yet in neither
case was there a sign of a reaction. Finally two electric tuning-forks,
one of 256, the other of 512 vibrations per second, were tried on the
animals taken one by one, and especial attention was given to the
regular movement of the little thread-like appendages which keep
up the current of water to the gills, with the idea that perhaps their
rate of movement might be affected. In no case was there the slightest
movement that could be referred to vibration, although here again the
tactile stimulus was very perceptible to the finger. None of these
experiments, then, give any indication that the crayfish reacts to vibratory
stimuli which to the human ear produce sound.</p>


<h4>III. R<span class="smcapa">OTATION</span> E<span class="smcapa">XPERIMENTS</span></h4>

<p>It has been found that the higher vertebrates, on being rotated on
a turn-table, exhibit all the symptoms which accompany the sensation
of dizziness in man. The question arises, to what degree and in what
manner do invertebrates respond to rotation? Schaefer,<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> the first
to take up this question, denied on rather meagre observations that
Crustacea respond in any way to rotation on the turn-table. Kreidl<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>
showed that this statement was altogether too sweeping, that PalÃ¦mon
reacts very definitely to rotation by running in the opposite direction.
Bunting<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> tried the crayfish, but all the rotation experiments resulted
negatively, so she was led to confirm Schaefer's statement so far as
the crayfish is concerned. Bethe<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> found that Carcinus behaved in
a very definite manner on being rotated, that during the rotation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633">[Pg 633]</a></span>
the animals ran in the opposite direction to that in which they were
turned, and as soon as the motion ceased they began running in the
other direction. Finally Lyon,<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> while agreeing with Bunting that
adult crayfish do not react to rotation, discovered that young animals
two or three centimetres long react very prettily to the movement,
going in a direction opposite to the turn. To confirm and if possible
extend these observations on the crayfish was the purpose of the
following experiments.</p>

<p>It was soon found that a great deal depended on the method of
experimentation. None of the experimenters mentioned above gives
any detailed description of the manner in which the experiments
were carried out. One is left uncertain whether the animals were
placed on the periphery of the turn-table or over the centre, whether
in the former case they were set with their heads toward the centre
or away from it, or placed at right angles to a radius, or whether
they were merely set down in any chance fashion and whirled about.
The same indefiniteness exists in most of the accounts as to how fast
they were turned, and whether the experiments were performed
in the air or in the water. Finally it is not stated whether the rotation
was always in the same direction, or whether its direction was alternated.</p>

<p>The turn-table used in the following experiments was one that had
to be turned by hand, so that it was impossible to regulate the speed
accurately. The crank, however, was not attached directly to the
rotating board, but was connected with it by means of a gearing so
that one turn of the crank produced about ten turns of the table.
This gearing gave a steadying effect to the motion so that the speed
could be kept tolerably constant. A circular pan, about 15 cm. in
diameter at the bottom with the sides slightly sloping outward, was
set so that its centre coincided with the axis of the rotating table. It
was in this pan that all the experiments were tried. Through various
preliminary experiments to determine the most favorable speed, it
was found that a rotation rate of over one turn of the table per second
produced such a strong centrifugal force that unless the animals
were set exactly over the centre they were swept off against the side
of the pan in such a manner that it was difficult to decide whether
the rotation as such had any effect upon their movements. It was
finally decided that the best results were obtained from a rate of
approximately one rotation in two seconds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_634" id="Page_634">[Pg 634]</a></span></p>

<p>It soon became evident that when the larger and more sluggish
crayfish were merely dropped in the pan and rotated there was no
particular reaction. This was true whether the animals rotated were
in the air or in the water. The smaller and more active crayfish,
however, showed a decided tendency to run either with or against
the direction of the rotation, especially when the experiments were
carried on in the water. In no case was there any tendency to go in
the opposite direction when the rotation ceased, except in so far as
the animals were carried along by the water. To get a quantitative
expression for these tendencies a more delicate method of experimentation
was resorted to. If there was a tendency on the part of the
active animal to move either with or against the rotation, such a
tendency might also be supposed to exist in the sluggish animal,
only in the latter the inertia was sufficiently strong to prevent its
appearance. If, however, the animals should be set radially to the
periphery of the pan, the tendency to go with or against the rotation
would be exhibited in the direction in which they turned out of the
radial position. For it was found that no animal would remain in that
position for any great length of time. Two groups of animals were
used for these experiments, five animals in each group, and the
first group was selected from the smallest and most active animals,
the second from the largest and most sluggish. Each animal was set in
two positions, position I, with the head toward the centre, position II,
with the head away from the centre. Each animal was given ten
trials in each position, and the number of times it turned in a direction
<em>with</em> the rotation is set down in the + column, the number of
times it turned <em>against</em> the rotation is indicated in the - column.
In general from 5 to 15 turns were necessary for the orientation of
the animal, though sometimes the number ran up to 30 or 40. Each
trial was made in the opposite direction to the preceding one, in
order to avoid the formation of any habit in turning. All these experiments
were carried out in water, the depth of which in the pan
was about 4 cm. In order that there should be no difference between
the velocity of the water and that of the pan, the table was rotated
a few times before the animal was put in. As a check a series of
experiments of 5 in each position was performed in the air on the
more active group.</p>

<p>The following table shows the results of these experiments in
rotation:</p>

<p>Examination of the table reveals great individual variation. Some
animals, as nos. 44, 49, and 37, turn rather constantly against the
direction of the rotation, while others, as nos. 56 and 36, are almost
as constant in their movement with the rotation. On the whole we
observe that for each group, and for Group 1 in both water and air,
there is a slightly greater tendency to go against the rotation than
with it. This tendency, strange to say, comes out much more clearly
in the air than in the water. It is evident, however, from the variation
exhibited that there is nothing very stereotyped or mechanical about
the reaction. Mention should be made of the fact that usually (though

<p>(1) <em>Geotaxis.</em> So far as my knowledge extends, no experimental
work has been done to determine the geotaxis of decapod Crustacea.
Most of the vertebrates are positively geotactic, while a great many
of the invertebrates, particularly unicellular organisms, larvÃ¦ of
moths and butterflies, slugs, etc., are negatively geotactic. Parker<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>
found that in the case of the Copepod, <em>Labidocera Ã¦stiva</em>, the females
exhibited strong, the males weak, negative geotaxis. In the investigation
of the geotaxis of the crayfish, two sets of experiments were
undertaken. In the first the method of procedure was as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636">[Pg 636]</a></span></p>

<p>On a level table before a window a board was so arranged that it could
be set at an inclination of 5&deg;, 10&deg;, 15&deg;, 20&deg;, and 25&deg; either toward or
away from the window. Starting, let us say, with the inclination
toward the window, each one of a group of five animals was placed
on the board with the right side to the window five times. The board
was then inclined the same amount away from the window and the
process was repeated. The same procedure was carried out with the
animals set with the left side to the window. The following table
gives the results of this set of experiments.</p>

<p>From this table it appears that the crayfish is positively geotactic,
and that the positive geotaxis increases regularly with the increase
in inclination. As a check on these results another set of experiments
was undertaken with different animals under different conditions.
The board was placed on a level table in the centre of a darkened
room, and the operator stood behind a screen so as to be quite hidden
from the animals. In order to observe the orientation a 2 c. incandescent
electric light was suspended directly above the spot where the
animals were set, at a distance of 60 cm. above the board. Each
animal of a group of five was set five times in each of four positions,
viz., head down the incline, head up the incline, and at right angles
to it with first the right and then the left side down the slope. The
results were as follows:</p>

<p>It will be observed that Tables IX and X agree quite well in the
main, and we may conclude that the crayfish is positively geotactic
and that the positive reactions vary from 58% at 5&deg; to 89% at 25&deg;.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Barotaxis.</em> Verworn<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> uses the term barotaxis in an inclusive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637">[Pg 637]</a></span>sense to cover all pressure phenomena that can be classed under the
sub-heads of thigmotaxis, rheotaxis, and geotaxis. It seems preferable
to me to employ the term in a more restricted sense of reaction
to pressure other than the pull of gravity, the flow of a current, or the
contact with bodies. The following experiment with the crayfish
furnishes us, I think, with a case in point.</p>

<p>A glass aquarium, 54 cm. long and 28 cm. wide, was so inclined
that the water was 20 cm. deep in one end and 8 cm. deep in the
other. A board was so anchored that one end rested on the bottom at
the shallow end of the aquarium while the other end projected slightly
out of and above the deepest water. The board was about 45 cm. long,
so that its slope was very gradual. Nine animals were placed in this
aquarium and observed for three successive days. If we denote the
bottom of the deep end of the aquarium by A, the shallow end under
the board by B, the shallow end on top of the board by C, and the
end of the board at the surface of the water by D, the results of
the observations were as follows: On the first day 1 animal was
found at D, 6 at C, and 2 at B. On the second day 5 were at C,
3 at B, and 1 at A. On the third day 1 was at D, 4 at C, and 4 at B.
Totals, 2 at D, 15 at C, 9 at B, and 1 at A.</p>

<p>While these observations were too few to base very positive statements
on, the striking fact that only one animal was found at A, the
deep end of the aquarium, whereas 15 were noted on top of the board
at C, indicates strongly that the animals avoid the deeper water.
That the animals were found <em>on top</em> of the board, not under it, indicates
that the observation is not to be referred to thigmotaxis,
although the latter is doubtless very strong, as we shall see later. It
should be observed that the negative barotaxis works against and
overcomes the marked positive geotaxis which, as we have just seen,
the animals exhibit in the air. Under the influence of the positive
geotaxis, we should expect to find the greater number of the animals
at A,&mdash;a condition which is speedily realized if we let the water
run out of the aquarium. We conclude, therefore, that at certain
pressures (specifically at the pressure exerted by water at a depth
of 20 cm.) the crayfish is negatively barotactic.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Turning.</em> In the experiments with light it was observed that
very seldom do the animals, when placed upon a surface, move off at
once in a straight line, but usually they first turn through an angle
of 90&deg; or more and then start off straight. This came out strongly in
the work on geotaxis, where oftentimes, when the animal was set with
the head up the incline, the reactions would be preponderantly positive,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638">[Pg 638]</a></span>
whereas when set with the head down the incline the reactions
were on the whole negative. In other words, when headed up the
incline the animal would go down, and when headed down he would
more often go up. Some experiments were tried under various conditions
to determine how general this tendency is. The table presents
the results in condensed form.</p>

<p>Table XI. No. II, first row, 90deg: the minus was added.</p>
</div>

<p>In this table the first line indicates the number of times each
animal turned less than 90&deg; when starting off from the position in
which it was set, the second line the number of times the amount of
turn was practically 90&deg;, and the third more than 90&deg;. The five parts
of the table mark the different conditions; in Part I twenty observations
were made on each animal placed on a level board before the
window, and set now with the right now with the left side toward the
window. In Parts II and III the animals were set with the head
turned now toward now away from the window. In Parts IV and V
the animals were placed on a level board in the middle of a darkened
room with a 2 c. light about three feet above them. This was to
exclude any possible directive influence of light. In all cases the
operator was concealed by a screen. In Parts I and V twenty observations
were made on each animal, in II and III ten, and in IV fifteen.</p>

<p>Rarely the animal would turn completely round and start off in the
direction originally set, but usually the turn was between 90&deg; and
180&deg;. When once the animal began to move off, it would ordinarily
keep to an approximately straight line. How seldom this was observed
when the animals were first set down may be judged from the
fact that out of a total of 375 observations in only 18 did the animals
move straight ahead from their original position. From the table
we observe that in over 65% of the cases (a proportion of almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_639" id="Page_639">[Pg 639]</a></span>
two to one) the animals turned through 90&deg; or more before starting
off. At present the writer has no explanation to offer for this phenomenon.</p>

and on the other hand there are animals that seek to get as
much of the surface of their bodies as possible in contact with objects.
The former are spoken of as negatively, the latter as positively
thigmotactic. Does the crayfish show any tendency in the one way
or the other, and if so is it positively or negatively thigmotactic?
In a large glass aquarium, 80 cm. long and 40 cm. wide, was a thin
wooden box, 22 cm. long and 16 cm. wide, set in one corner 4 cm.
from the glass walls. At the bottom of the box was an opening where
the crayfish could enter. The following table shows the disposition
of the animals for 27 different days, on which one examination was
made each day. Line I indicates the number of times each animal
was found against the walls of the aquarium, line II in the 4 cm.
space between the box and the walls of the aquarium, line III inside
the box against its sides, and line IV resting freely in the middle of
the aquarium or in the middle of the box.</p>

<p>In order to appreciate the significance of the figures in this table
it is necessary to consider the amount of lateral surface with which
it was possible to come in contact in each case. In IV of course it
was zero, in III it was 76 cm. with four corners in close proximity,
in II it was only 38 cm. and one corner, but the space was so narrow
that there was practically a contact-surface on both sides, and in I
there was 212 cm. of lateral surface with three corners. I mention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_640" id="Page_640">[Pg 640]</a></span>
corners in this connection because they were almost invariably occupied.
If we examine the table with these facts in mind, we find,
(1) that the number of animals resting freely without contact with any
lateral surface is very small, only about 6% of the whole; (2) that
the number of animals found in the narrow space between the box
and the walls of the aquarium is very large in proportion to the
length of the space: indeed the animals were frequently found
wedged into this space three or four deep; (3) that the number of
animals found in the box was probably due largely to the fact that
they found in it a greater lateral contact-surface, particularly in the
corners, than was possible outside.</p>

<p>Two or three minor considerations are of interest. The animals
were frequently observed "on edge" about half out of the water,
that is, with the ventral surface of the body pressed against the
vertical surface against which they were resting. This was also
observed where the water was so deep that none of the members
could touch the bottom. It was perhaps on account of the quality
of the surface affording a rougher contact that so large a number of
the animals were found in contact with the wooden box rather than
the smooth, slippery surface of the glass. In the centre of the aquarium
a wooden stopper 2 cm. in diameter projected about 15 cm. above the
surface of the water. Very often a crayfish would be found almost at
the top of this stopper, completely out of the water. This tendency
to climb was frequently observed in the light-reaction experiments,
where the animals would climb up on any piece of wood that chanced
to be left in the box. It reminds one of the tree-climbing crabs of the
West and East Indies. Along the creeks of Ohio I have frequently
seen crayfish that had climbed up on logs or sticks that projected
some feet out of the water.</p>

<p>In the table we see decided evidences of "habit" in the sense of
an animal returning to the same place which it had occupied. No.
5 has almost half the observations in the open, nos. 21, 37, and 39
showed a decided preference for the space between the box and the
aquarium wall, while nos. 38, 44, and 52 were more frequently found
on the inside of the box. This recurrence to a particular position
also came out in the light-reaction work, where an individual would
return to the same spot in the box for days at a time as soon as
released.</p>

<p>From the above considerations we conclude that the crayfish is
strongly positively thigmotactic and that this thigmotaxis probably
plays a most important part in the life of the animal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_641" id="Page_641">[Pg 641]</a></span></p>

<p>(2) <em>Touch Reactions.</em> Lemoine<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> investigated the reactions of
crayfish to touch-stimuli and found that the plates of the telson, the
sternal portions of the thorax, the abdominal pleopods, the chelÃ¦,
and particularly the antennÃ¦ toward their points are especially
sensitive, but that nowhere, even on the back of the carapace, is a
touch-stimulus altogether devoid of reaction. Gulland<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> found that
a needle could be inserted between the tufts of setÃ¦ on the chelÃ¦
without causing any reaction, but as soon as one of the hairs was
touched, the chelÃ¦ closed with a snap. Considering the setÃ¦ as the
organs of touch, he claimed to have found that the eyes, eye-stalks,
and carapace (which he says have no setÃ¦) are impervious to tactile
impressions. This claim of Gulland's is strangely at variance with
the facts. In no case have I been able to bring about retraction of the
eye-stalk by visual stimulation, but a very light touch-stimulus on the
eye itself or on the eye-stalk or a stronger stimulus on some portion of
the head will cause the eye to be drawn in. It is true that after repeated
stimulation the eye is retracted no longer, and with a heavy
bristle one can make a perceptible indentation in the corneal surface
without the eye being withdrawn.</p>

<p>The antennÃ¦, from their anatomical structure, their position, and
the manner in which they are carried, are generally considered the special
organs of touch. Nevertheless, as far as the reactions of the animal
are concerned, a stimulation of the antennÃ¦ by touch produces a
less decided response than almost any other portion of the body. If the
stimulus is very light no reaction at all is observed in most cases, and if
stronger the antennÃ¦ are moved away, but that is all. A stimulation
of the edge of the telson produces a more decided reaction. Either the
animal folds it under the abdomen at once or faces about like a flash
in an attitude of defence; frequently both reactions occur. While
the response to stimulation of the chelÃ¦ was decided, that to touch
on the first chelipedes was quicker and more accurate. The mouth-parts
are also very sensitive to touch. I cannot agree with Gulland's
assertions as to the insensitiveness of the carapace, for I have been
able to find no place upon it where a light-stimulation would not
produce a reaction. In this connection a curious phenomenon is
characteristic of the animal. If the carapace or the front portion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_642" id="Page_642">[Pg 642]</a></span>
the abdomen be lightly stroked with a solid object such as a pencil,
the animal will slowly turn toward the stimulus on its antero-posterior
axis. If, now, a like stimulus be applied on the other side, the animal
will roll back through the normal position to a like inclination toward
the stimulus on the other side. If the alternation be kept up and the
change made quickly, a continuous and curious rolling movement
is maintained, the animal growing more and more excited until it
scampers off with a kind of cramp-like motion. With some animals
this rolling reflex is more marked than with others, but in no case is
it altogether lacking. Some animals have been known to roll so far
over that they topple over on their backs. Dr. Yerkes informs me that
he has observed the same phenomenon in a less degree with turtles
when the edge of their shell is stimulated by scratching. The movement
seems to be caused by the reflex stimulation of the extensor
muscles on the opposite side of the body from the part stimulated.
The thrust of the legs thereby brought about raises that side of the
body and thus causes a rotation to some extent about the antero-posterior
axis. But how was this connection between the stimulation
of one side of the body and the contraction of the extensor muscles
of the other side established? I have no doubt that it is intimately
connected with the positive thigmotaxis described above. These
animals live under loose stones for the most part, and thus the carapace
gets a great deal of stimulation. If the animal is stimulated on
one side, a contraction of the extensor muscles of the opposite side
tends to roll the animal toward the source of the stimulus, and hence
to increase the contact. In the race-history of the animal this has
doubtless been advantageous in enabling it to escape the dangers of
its habitat.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In a succeeding paper the writer hopes to discuss the reactions
of the crayfish to chemical stimuli. In conclusion he desires to make
acknowledgment to Dr. Robert M. Yerkes of the Harvard Psychological
Laboratory for kindly suggestions and helpful criticism
throughout the course of the investigation.</p>


<h4>S<span class="smcapa">UMMARY</span></h4>

<p>(1) Crayfish are somewhat negatively phototactic, going away
from rather than toward the source of light in the ratio of 62% to
38%. The different intensities employed in this investigation produced
very little difference in the reactions. The average reaction-time
was much less for the group of animals which showed the highest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_643" id="Page_643">[Pg 643]</a></span>
percentage of negative reactions, indicating a greater general sensitiveness.
Variations of the position in which the animals were set
affected the results very slightly.</p>

<p>(2) Previous confinement in the dark tended to increase slightly
the number of negative reactions, and previous exposure to strong
light tended to decrease the number, but the results were not constant.
An increase in temperature tended to decrease the number
of negative reactions to light, but here again the results were somewhat
conflicting.</p>

<p>(3) Reactions to horizontal colored light showed a tendency to go
to the colored light rather than to the white in the following order:
Blue 47%, green 50.5%, black (or the absence of light) 51%, red
54%, yellow 59%. In the case of vertical colored light the comparison
with the white resulted somewhat differently, as follows:
Green 53%, yellow 53.5%, blue 57%, black 57%, red 72.5%. In
the latter experiments the animals showed a marked and constant
preference for the red.</p>

<p>(4) The animals showed no signs of reaction to static objects
from visual stimulation, i. e., there is no evidence of visual perception
of form in the case of stationary objects. Moving objects, especially
large ones, are plainly perceived and definitely reacted to.</p>

<p>(5) There were no reactions whatever caused by those vibrations
which to the human ear produce sound. So far as these experiments
go, the animals cannot be said to hear.</p>

<p>(6) In rotation experiments individual animals were rather constant
in moving either with or against the direction of the rotation, but no
definite tendency for all animals was observed.</p>

<p>(7) The pull of gravity was followed with constantly increasing
frequency from 58% at 5&deg; to 89% at 25&deg;. Therefore we conclude that
the animals are positively geotactic. They are negatively barotactic,
avoiding the pressure of water at the depth of 20 cm., and this is
sufficient to overcome their positive geotaxis. When placed upon a
level surface the animals show a peculiar tendency to turn through
a greater or less angle before starting out in a straight line. In only
18 out of 375 observations, or 5%, did the animals start straight,
in 30% they turned through an angle of less than 90&deg;, and in 65%
they turned through an angle of 90&deg; or more.</p>

<p>(8) The crayfish is positively thigmotactic in a marked degree, as
is indicated by the fact that in only 33 out of 572 observations, or less
than 6%, were the animals found resting in the open, while in 190,
or 33%, they were found in a narrow opening between two vertical
surfaces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_644" id="Page_644">[Pg 644]</a></span></p>

<p>(9) The animal is sensitive to touch over the whole surface of the
body, but especially on the chelÃ¦ and chelipedes, the mouth-parts,
the ventral surface of the abdomen, and the edge of the telson. If
one side of the carapace or of the dorsal surface of the abdomen be
stimulated, the extensors of the legs on the opposite side are contracted,
and the animal turns on its antero-posterior axis toward the
source of the stimulus. If opposite sides be stimulated alternately,
a peculiar rolling motion is set up.</p>

appeared a dark grayish splotch of light, very much darker than the rest of the
image. This is due, most probably, to the presence of Charpentier's phenomenon
of recurrent bands. If this happens in this figure the ends of the recurrent bright
images would overlap while the centres would not, so that the black bands appearing,
as it were, through interstices in the central part of the figure, would seem like
a dark splotch, especially since the outlines of the bands are vague and hazy. The
back end of the figure had the effect of being vertical or nearly so. This is probably
due to the same cause as that which made the circular figure to appear as it did,
namely, the negative after-image overlapping the positive after-image. The front
of this black image is usually of about the same shape as the front of the real figure
which it follows. If this is so, then, in this case, it would make the back part of
the image pretty nearly vertical.</p></div>

If there were no reÃ«nforcement of stimulation the whole figure would be flat on
top and of this height. The difference between <em>AB</em> and <em>AC</em>, or <em>BC</em>, represents the
increase of intensity due to irradiation at the most favorably situated portion of
the figure. The other portions receive increments proportional to their location,
as indicated in the diagram.</p></div>

in which the point is situated. Thus one in the angle of a triangle or at the horn of
a crescent would have much less reÃ«nforcement of excitation than another point,

white light as being of a blackness more intense than the ordinary blackness of an
entirely dark room. This is perfectly true. The black image, however, lasts for a
very much longer time than the recurrent images of the same light. Often this
velvety black band would trail along behind the moving light for the distance of
a foot or more, gradually lightening into the darkness of the background.</p></div>

ist wahr, dass GefÃ¼hle sehr lebhafte motorische Ruckwirkungen Ã¤ussern; wir sehen
die Respiration in Unordnung gerathen, den Druck der Arterienwandung auf das
Blut bei heftigen Schmerzen zunehmen, Erbrechen auf widrige GeschmackseindrÃ¼cke,
allgemeine MuskelkrÃ¤mpfe bei physischen Martern eintreten." All the
principal physiological features of feelings are enumerated here, but one hardly
will give any great credit for priority to Lotze. Such a general statement, in fact,
belongs to the class of easy observations from which philosophical speculation
often starts. G. L. Duprat shows that the same "observations" underlie the theories
of Aristotle, Hippocrates, and Plato. (Duprat: La psycho-physiologie des

Landois, presupposes a certain theory of the origin of the secondary elevations.
(Edgren: Cardiographische und sphygmographische Untersuchungen, Skandinavisches
Archiv. f. Physiologie, vol. 1, p. 92, 1889.) It is not easy to change a
terminology, and the Greek terms, some of which were used by and before Galen,
are so indifferently connotative that they can be kept without inconvenience. If
one were to be rigorous, one would change the name of the sphygmograph into
palmograph, because this instrument does not serve exclusively for the registration
of the abnormal pulse. It does seem, however, advisable to drop the terms recoil
wave (RÃ¼ckstosselevation, Landois), and "onde de rebondissement" (Marey),
because they are taken from modern languages and directly suggest a certain theory
with which they are intimately connected.</p></div>

explanation of the dicrotic belongs to this type (Comptes Rendus, vol. 47, p. 826,
22 Nov., 1858.) He supposed that the dicrotic elevation was due to a wave reflected
from the Iliacae communes. He was led to this theory by the erroneous observation
of Beau, that abnormal dicrotism never occurs in the lower extremities.
Marey's own observations refuted this theory, since they show that the dicrotic
elevation is found also in the sphygmograms of the arteries of the leg. (Marey, La
circulation du sang, p. 274, 1863.)</p></div>

("Omnes enim clare cernunt, omnes partes arteriarum eodem distendi tempore,"
De causis pulsi, book 2, c. 8). The first who saw that the pulse did not appear
at the same time in all the parts of the body was Josias Weitbrecht, but his observations
were neglected until E. H. Weber actually measured the velocity of the
propagation of the pulse wave. (His famous thesis of 1827,&mdash;"Pulsum arteriarum
non in omnibus arteriis simul, sed in arteriis a corde valde remotis serius
quam in corde et in arteriis cordi vicinis fieri.") For the results of other measurements
see Tigerstedt: Physiologie des Kreislaufes, p. 385, 1894. Some use of these
measurements is made in the present writer's L'Analyse des Sphygmogrammes,
which is to appear in the Journal de Physiologie et de Pathologie GÃ©nÃ©rale for

sphygmograms and the plethysmograms. It was stated recently that for this
reason the plethysmograph could not be used for psychological experiments. An
analysis of the mechanical conditions of these two instruments shows that also
the sphygmogram must show some plethysmographic influences, and the author
supplied experimental evidence for this result.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_82_82" id="Footnote_82_82"></a><a href="#FNanchor_82_82"><span class="label">[82]</span></a> More recent publications have taken this view. Cohn speaks of "OrgangefÃ¼hle
des Gehirns," approaching Meynert's view on the causes of pleasure and pain.
(P. Cohn: GemÃ¼thserregungen und Krankheiten, pp. 23 and 50, 1903.)
Cohn's book shows clearly that this theory belongs to the type of philosophical
explanations. This is also suggested by Duprat who remarked the parallelism
between the theories of James, Lange and Ribot, and the theories of certain Greek
philosophers. (Duprat: "La psycho-physiologie des sentiments dans la philosophie
ancienne," Archiv f. Geschichte d. Philosophie, vol. 18 (3), p. 395, 1905.)</p></div>

0.99999999891 for the males and Â½[1+&#966;(15.93)] for the females. It is therefore
almost certain, theoretically, that even and uneven numbers have not the same
frequency. See Czuber, Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung, 1903, pp. 158-161. The

small number of correct position choices was probably due to his using ten boxes
instead of six, as in the other two series. My results given in Table XI were secured

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
